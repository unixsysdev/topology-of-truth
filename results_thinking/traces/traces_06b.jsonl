Natalia sold clips to 48 friends in April, and then she sold half as many in May. I need to find out how many clips she sold altogether in April and May. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, in April, she sold 48 clips. That's straightforward. Then, in May, she sold half as many as in April. So half of 48. Let me calculate that. Half of 48... Well, 48 divided by 2 is 24. So in May, she sold 24 clips.\n\nNow, to find the total number of clips sold in both months, I just need to add the number of clips sold in April and the number sold in May. So that would be 48 plus 24. Let me add those numbers. 48 plus 24... Let me think. 40 plus 20 is 60, and 8 plus 4 is 12, so altogether 72. So the total is 72 clips.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. April: 48, May: half of 48 is 24. 48 + 24 is indeed 72. Yeah, that seems right.

I need to figure out how much she earned. Hmm, so first, I should convert the time she worked into hours because the rate is given per hour. \n\nRight, 50 minutes is how many hours? Well, there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, I can divide 50 by 60 to get the number of hours she worked. Let me do that calculation. 50 divided by 60... Hmm, 50 divided by 60 is the same as 5/6. So, 5/6 hours. \n\nNow, to find the earnings, I need to multiply the number of hours by the hourly rate. The hourly rate is $12. So, 5/6 hours times $12. Let me write that out: (5/6) * 12. \n\nWait, maybe I can simplify this before multiplying. 12 divided by 6 is 2, so 5 times 2 is 10. So, that would be $10. Let me check that again. If she worked 50 minutes, which is 5/6 of an hour, and she earns $12 per hour, then 5/6 of 12 is indeed 10. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 50 minutes divided by 60 minutes per hour. So, 50/60. Simplify that fraction. Both numbers are divisible by 10, so 5/6. Then multiply by 12. 5 times 12 is 60, and 6 times 12 is 72. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 5/6 of 12. So, 12 divided by 6 is 2, and 5 times 2 is 10. Yeah, that's correct. \n\nSo, the answer should be $10. Let me just verify once more. If she worked 50 minutes, which is 5/6 of an hour, and she gets $12 per hour, then 5/6 * 12. Let's compute 5/6 * 12. 12 divided by 6 is 2, so 5 times 2 is 10. Yep, that's $10. \n\nI think that's it. There's no trick here, just converting minutes to hours and multiplying. So, the answer is $10.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how much Weng earned, we start by converting the time she worked into hours.

But she only has half of the money she needs. So first, I need to figure out how much money Betty currently has. If she has half, then half of $100 is $50. So she has $50 already. \n\nThen, her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose. So adding that to her current savings, her total would be $50 + $15. Let me calculate that. 50 plus 15 is $65. So now she has $65.\n\nNext, her grandparents gave her twice as much as her parents. Her parents gave $15, so twice that would be $30. Adding that to her current total, $65 + $30.

The question is asking how many pages he writes a year. Hmm, so I need to figure out the total number of pages he writes in a year based on his weekly writing habits.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many weeks are in a year. I remember that a year is approximately 52 weeks. Let me confirm that. Yeah, 52 weeks in a year. So if he writes twice a week, then over 52 weeks, that would be 2 times 52. Let me calculate that. 2 times 50 is 100, and 2 times 2 is 4, so total is 104. So that's 104 letters per year.\n\nNow, each letter is 3 pages. So to find the total pages, I need to multiply the number of letters by the number of pages per letter. So 104 letters times 3 pages. Let me do that multiplication. 100 times 3 is 300, and 4 times 3 is 12, so total is 312 pages. \n\nWait, let me check again. 2 times 52 is 104. 104 times 3.

How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?", "gold_answer": "35", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how many flowers Mark has in his garden. Hmm, the problem says he planted plants of three different colors: yellow, purple, and green. Ten are yellow. Then there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow. And there are 25% as many green flowers as yellow and purple. We need to find the total number of flowers.\n\nFirst, let me note down the given information:\n\n- Yellow flowers: 10\n- Purple flowers: 80% more than yellow\n- Green flowers: 25% as many as yellow and purple combined\n\nSo, maybe I should start by finding the number of purple flowers. Since there are 80% more purple than yellow, that means purple is 100% + 80% = 180% of yellow. So, purple = 1.8 times yellow. Let me check that. If yellow is 10, then 80% more would be 10 + 80% of 10 = 10 + 8 = 18. So purple is 18. Okay, that seems right.\n\nThen, green flowers are 25% as many as yellow and purple. So first, I need to find the total number of yellow and purple flowers, then take 25% of that total. Let me write that down.\n\nTotal yellow and purple = 10 (yellow) + 18 (purple) = 28 flowers.\n\nGreen flowers = 25% of 28. Let me calculate that. 25% is 0.25, so 0.25 * 28 = 7. So green is 7.\n\nTherefore, total flowers would be yellow + purple + green = 10 + 18 + 7 = 35. Wait, is that all? Let me check again.\n\nYellow: 10\n\nPurple: 18 (which is 1.8 times 10)\n\nGreen: 7 (which is 25% of 28)\n\nTotal: 10 + 18 + 7 = 35. Hmm, that seems straightforward. But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the percentage calculations.\n\nOriginal problem says \"there are 80% more of those in purple\". So purple is 80% more than yellow. So if yellow is 10, then purple is 10 + 80% of 10 = 10 + 8 = 18. Correct. Then green is 25% of yellow and purple. So total yellow and purple is 10 + 18 = 28. 25% of 28 is indeed 7. So total flowers 10 + 18 + 7 = 35. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Sometimes percentage problems can be tricky. Let me check if there's another way to interpret \"there are 80% more of those in purple\". Maybe it's 80% of purple? But no, the wording is \"there are 80% more of those in purple\". So that would mean that the number of purple is 80% more than yellow. Which is what I did. So purple is 18. Green is 25% of yellow and purple. So 25% of 28 is 7. So total is 35. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use variables to represent the unknowns. Let me try that approach to verify.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet y = number of yellow flowers = 10.\n\nLet p = number of purple flowers.\n\nLet g = number of green flowers.\n\nGiven:\n\np = y + 80% of y = 10 + 0.8*10 = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\ng = 25% of (y + p) = 0.25*(10 + 18) = 0.25*28 = 7.\n\nTotal flowers = y + p + g = 10 + 18 + 7 = 35.\n\nSame result. So seems like 35 is the answer. But let me check once more for any possible miscalculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of percentages. Let me check if 80% more purple is 18. If yellow is 10, then 80% more would be 10 + 8 = 18. Correct. Then green is 25% of (yellow + purple). So 25% of 28 is 7. So total is 35. Yes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check with another method. Let me think about the total percentage. If yellow is 10, purple is 18, green is 7. Let me add them up. 10 + 18 is 28, plus 7 is 35. So total flowers is 35. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if there's a possibility that green is 25% of yellow and purple combined, meaning 25% of (yellow + purple). Which is exactly what I did. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 35. So the number of flowers Mark has in his garden is 35.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{35}\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many flowers Mark has in his garden, we start by analyzing the information provided:\n\n- **Yellow flowers**: 10\n- **Purple flowers**: 80% more than yellow.  \n  This means purple flowers = 10 + 80% of 10 = 10 + 8 = **18**\n- **Green flowers**: 25% as many as yellow and purple combined.  \n  So, green flowers = 25% of (yellow + purple) = 25% of (10 + 18) = 25% of 28 = **7**\n\nNow, to find the total number of flowers, we sum the number of yellow, purple, and green flowers:\n\n$$\n\\text{Total flowers} = 10 + 18 + 7 = 35\n$$\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer**  \n$$\n\\boxed{35}\n$$", "final_answer": "35", "num_tokens": 1370, "num_reasoning_steps": 38, "activations_path": "results_thinking/embeddings/q_0005_06b_activations.npz"}

Let me break that down.\n\nFor the large pizzas: 2 pizzas multiplied by 16 slices each. Let me calculate that. 2 times 16... that's 32 slices. Okay, so that's 32 slices from the large ones.\n\nThen, the small pizzas: 2 pizzas multiplied by 8 slices each. Let me do that. 2 times 8... that's 16 slices.

So, Ken started with a box on a scale, and then he added some jelly beans, brownies, jelly beans, and gummy worms. The weights after each addition are given, and we need to find the total weight. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that initially, the box is on a scale, and then Ken poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds. Then he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple. Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans. Finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight again. The question is asking for the final weight.\n\nLet me note down each step:\n\n1. Initial weight of the box: Let's call this W. Then, Ken adds jelly beans to make the weight 2 pounds. So, the weight after adding jelly beans is 2 pounds.\n\n2. Then, he adds brownies, which causes the weight to triple. So, the weight after adding brownies is 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.\n\n3. Then, he adds another 2 pounds of jelly beans. So, the weight after this addition is 6 + 2 = 8 pounds.\n\n4. Finally, he adds enough gummy worms to double the weight again. So, the weight after adding gummy worms is 8 * 2 = 16 pounds.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check again. The problem says \"added enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.\" Then he added brownies to cause the weight to triple. Then added another 2 pounds of jelly beans. Then added gummy worms to double the weight again. So, the order is:\n\nStart with W.\n\nAdd jelly beans: W + jelly beans = 2.\n\nAdd brownies: 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nAdd jelly beans: 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nAdd gummy worms: 8 * 2 = 16.\n\nTherefore, the final weight is 16 pounds. Hmm, that seems straightforward. But let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the weight to triple\" after adding brownies. So, starting from 2 pounds, adding brownies triples it. So, 2 * 3 = 6. Then adding another 2 pounds of jelly beans brings it to 6 + 2 = 8. Then adding gummy worms doubles it to 16. So yes, 16 pounds. Therefore, the answer should be 16 pounds.\n\nBut let me think again. Is there any chance that the initial weight is different? The problem says \"Ken placed a box on a scale, and then he poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.\" So, the initial weight is before adding anything. Then he adds jelly beans to make it 2. Then adds brownies to triple the weight. So, the initial weight is W, then after adding jelly beans, it's W + jelly beans = 2. Then adding brownies makes it 2 * 3 = 6. Then adding another 2 pounds of jelly beans: 6 + 2 = 8. Then adding gummy worms to double the weight again: 8 * 2 = 16. So yes, 16 pounds. Therefore, the final weight is 16 pounds.\n\nI don't see any errors in this reasoning. Each step is straightforward. The key is to track the weight after each addition.

She spent some money on shirts, pants, coat, socks, and a belt, and then she lost the shoes' receipt. Now she has $16 left. The question is asking how much she paid for the shoes. \n\nFirst, I need to add up all the amounts she spent on the clothes and then subtract the remaining $16 to find out how much she spent on the shoes. Let me check the numbers again to make sure I have them right.\n\nShe spent $30 on a button-up shirt. Then $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. Let me add those up step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the shirt: $30. Then adding the pants: 30 + 46 = $76. Then adding the coat: 76 + 38 = $114. Then adding the socks: 114 + 11 = $125. Finally, adding the belt: 125 + 18 = $143. So, total spent on clothes is $143. \n\nHer budget was $200, and she has $16 left. Therefore, the shoes must have cost $200 minus $143 minus $16. Let me calculate that. \n\nFirst, subtract $143 from $200: 200 - 143 = 57. Then subtract $16: 57 - 16 = $41. \n\nSo, Alexis paid $41 for the shoes. Let me just verify once more to be sure. \n\nTotal spent on clothes: 30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18. Let me add them again:\n\n30 + 46 is 76. 76 + 38 is 114. 114 + 11 is 125. 125 + 18 is 143. Yes, that's correct. \n\nBudget was $200, remaining $16.

If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.  If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?", "gold_answer": "990", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Tina earns $18.00 per hour. If she works more than 8 hours, she gets overtime. The problem says she works 10 hours every day for 5 days. So first, I need to figure out how many hours she works in total. Let me calculate that.\n\nEach day she works 10 hours, so over 5 days, that would be 10 hours/day multiplied by 5 days. Let me do the math: 10 times 5 is 50 hours. So she works 50 hours in total. Now, since she works more than 8 hours, which is 8 hours or more, she gets overtime. But wait, does she work more than 8 hours each day? The problem says she works 10 hours every day. So each day she works 10 hours, which is definitely more than 8. Therefore, she gets overtime for each day. \n\nNow, overtime is paid by her hourly wage plus half of her hourly wage. So that means she gets double her regular hourly rate for overtime. Let me confirm that. If her regular rate is $18, then overtime is $18 + 0.5*$18. Let me calculate that. 0.5 times 18 is 9, so total overtime is 18 + 9 = $27 per hour. \n\nSo, for each day, she works 10 hours, which is regular 8 hours plus overtime 2 hours. So the total earnings would be regular pay plus overtime pay. \n\nFirst, let's calculate her regular earnings. Regular hours are 8 hours per day. So 8 hours/day * $18/hour. Let me compute that: 8*18. 8*10 is 80, 8*8 is 64, so total is 144. So regular earnings are $144 per day. \n\nThen, for the overtime hours, which are 2 hours per day. Overtime pay is $27 per hour. So 2 hours * $27/hour. Let me calculate that: 2*27 is 54. \n\nTherefore, total earnings per day would be regular + overtime = 144 + 54 = $200. \n\nSince she works 5 days, total earnings would be 5 days * $200. Let me compute that: 5*200 is $1,000. \n\nWait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me verify each step once more.\n\nFirst, total hours: 10 hours/day * 5 days = 50 hours. Correct.\n\nOvertime hours: 50 hours - 8 hours (regular) = 42 hours? Wait, hold on. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says she works more than 8 hours per shift. If she works 10 hours every day, that's more than 8, so she gets overtime. But does that mean she works 10 hours, which includes both regular and overtime? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.\" So does that mean that if she works more than 8 hours, she gets overtime, regardless of how many hours she works? So if she works 10 hours, that's more than 8, so she gets overtime. But does that mean that she works 10 hours, which includes both regular and overtime? Or is the overtime only for the extra hours beyond 8? \n\nWait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again: \"If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.\" So maybe the overtime is only for the hours beyond 8. So if she works 10 hours, that's 8 regular and 2 overtime. So total hours is 10. So regular hours are 8, overtime is 2. \n\nBut if she works 10 hours, does that mean that she works 8 regular and 2 overtime? Or does she work 10 hours, which is more than 8, so she gets overtime for all the hours beyond 8? \n\nThis is a critical point. If the problem says she works more than 8 hours per shift, then she is eligible for overtime. But does that mean that she works 10 hours, which includes both regular and overtime? Or does it mean that she works 10 hours, and the overtime is only for the extra hours beyond 8? \n\nThe problem says \"If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.\" So the wording suggests that if she works more than 8 hours, she gets overtime. So perhaps the overtime is only for the hours beyond 8. Therefore, if she works 10 hours, that's 8 regular and 2 overtime. \n\nBut maybe the problem is that she works 10 hours, which is more than 8, so she gets overtime for all those hours. So total hours is 10, which includes both regular and overtime. \n\nBut in that case, the calculation would be different. Let me check both possibilities. \n\nFirst possibility: total hours is 10, regular 8, overtime 2. \n\nSecond possibility: total hours is 10, regular 8, and overtime is 2. \n\nBut if she works 10 hours, and the overtime is paid by her hourly wage plus half, then regardless of how many hours she works, if she works more than 8, she gets overtime. So maybe the problem is that she works 10 hours, which is more than 8, so she gets overtime for all those hours. \n\nBut then, the calculation would be: regular hours are 8, overtime hours are 2. \n\nBut if she works 10 hours, then the regular hours are 8, and the overtime is 2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that she works 10 hours, which is more than 8, so she gets overtime for all those hours. Therefore, total hours is 10, regular 8, overtime 2. \n\nBut then, the problem says \"If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.\" So maybe the overtime is only for the hours beyond 8. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. However, given that the problem says \"If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.\" So perhaps the overtime is only for the hours beyond 8. Therefore, if she works 10 hours, that's 8 regular and 2 overtime. \n\nBut let me check with the numbers. Let's suppose she works 10 hours. So regular 8 hours, overtime 2. \n\nSo regular earnings: 8 * 18 = 144. \n\nOvertime earnings: 2 * (18 + 9) = 2 * 27 = 54. \n\nTotal earnings: 144 + 54 = 200 per day. \n\nOver 5 days: 200 * 5 = 1000. \n\nAlternatively, if she works 10 hours, which is more than 8, so she gets overtime for all 10 hours. Then, regular hours are 8, overtime is 2. \n\nSame result. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that she works 10 hours, which is more than 8, so she gets overtime for all 10 hours. Therefore, total hours is 10. \n\nBut then, the calculation would be same. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that she works 10 hours, which is more than 8, so she gets overtime for all those hours. Therefore, total hours is 10. \n\nTherefore, regardless of whether she works 10 hours or more, the calculation is same. \n\nTherefore, total earnings would be 5 days * 200 = $1,000. \n\nBut let me check once more. \n\nTotal hours: 10 per day * 5 days = 50 hours. \n\nRegular hours: 8 hours. \n\nOvertime hours: 50 - 8 = 42 hours. \n\nWait, hold on! Wait, if she works 10 hours per day, that's 10 hours. If she works more than 8 hours, she gets overtime. But if she works 10 hours, that's 8 regular and 2 overtime.

Hmm, the problem says that the monster rises every hundred years and consumes 847 people over three hundred years. Also, each new ship has twice as many people as the last one. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the information. The monster eats 847 people over 300 years. But the question is specifically about the first hundred years. So, maybe I need to figure out how many ships were there over those 100 years and then determine the number of people on each ship?\n\nWait, the problem says that each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. So, if we consider the ships over the 300 years, starting from the first one, each subsequent ship is double the previous one. But how many ships are there over 300 years? Let me think.\n\nLet me denote the number of ships over the first hundred years as S. Then, over the next hundred years (from the first hundred to the third hundred), there would be another S ships. So total ships would be 2S. But the problem says that over 300 years, the monster consumed 847 people. So, if each ship has a certain number of people, then the total number of people would be the sum of the people on each ship.\n\nBut how do we find the number of people on each ship? Let me think. Let me denote the number of people on the first ship as P. Then, the second ship would have 2P, the third would have 4P, and so on. Since each subsequent ship is double the previous one, the number of people on each ship is P, 2P, 4P, 8P, etc.\n\nBut how many terms are there in this sequence? If the monster consumed 847 people over 300 years, and assuming that the number of ships is 2S, then the total number of people would be P*(1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^{n-1}) where n is the number of ships. Wait, but maybe there's a different way to think about it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of ships over 300 years is 300 years divided into two periods: first 100 years and next 200 years. But the problem says \"Over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people.\" So, maybe the total number of people is the sum of the people on each ship over those 300 years. But how does the number of ships relate to the time?\n\nWait, the problem says \"each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship.\" So, if we consider the ships over the 300 years, starting from the first ship, each subsequent ship is double the previous one. Therefore, the number of people on each ship is P, 2P, 4P, 8P, ..., up to some term. The total number of people would be the sum of a geometric series.\n\nBut how many terms are there? Let me think. If the monster consumed 847 people over 300 years, and assuming that the number of ships is 300, then each ship would have 847/300 people? But that seems too straightforward, and the problem mentions that each new ship has twice as many as the last. So maybe the number of ships is not 300, but something else?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is structured such that over the 300 years, the monster ate 847 people, and each subsequent ship is double the previous one. Therefore, the number of people on each ship is P, 2P, 4P, 8P, ..., and the total is P*(1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^{n-1}) = P*(2^n - 1). And this total is 847. Therefore, we need to find P such that 2^n - 1 = 847, where n is the number of ships. But 2^n - 1 = 847 implies 2^n = 848. But 2^9 = 512, 2^10 = 1024. So 848 is not a power of 2. Therefore, this approach might not work. Therefore, maybe my assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of ships is not 300, but the number of ships over 300 years is such that the total is 847. Let me think again. Let me denote that the first ship has x people, the second has 2x, the third has 4x, and so on. The total number of people over 300 years would be x*(1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^{n-1}) = x*(2^n - 1). And this total is 847. Therefore, solving for x, we need to find n such that 2^n - 1 = 847. But as before, 2^9 = 512, 2^10 = 1024. So 847 is between 2^9 and 2^10. Therefore, there is no integer n for which 2^n - 1 equals 847. Therefore, this suggests that my initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is not about the number of ships over 300 years, but that the monster ate 847 people over 300 years, and each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. Therefore, perhaps the number of people on each ship is decreasing? Wait, no, the problem says \"each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship.\" So, if the first ship has x people, the second has 2x, third has 4x, etc. So the number of people on each ship is increasing exponentially. Therefore, the total number of people would be a geometric series. But since 847 is not a power of 2 minus 1, this suggests that maybe the number of ships is not 300, but something else. Wait, but the problem says \"Over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people.\" So maybe the total number of people is 847, and the number of ships is such that each subsequent ship is double the previous one. Therefore, perhaps the number of ships is 3, 4, or something else?\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me denote that the first ship has x people, the second has 2x, the third has 4x, and so on. The total number of people over 300 years would be x*(1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^{n-1}) = x*(2^n - 1). And this total is 847. Therefore, solving for x, we need to find n such that 2^n - 1 = 847. But as before, 2^9 = 512, 2^10 = 1024. Therefore, 847 is between 2^9 and 2^10. Therefore, there is no integer n for which 2^n - 1 equals 847.

Therefore, perhaps the number of people on each ship is decreasing? Wait, no, the problem says \"each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship.\" So, if the last ship is the one that was eaten, then the next ship is double that. Therefore, the number of people on each ship is increasing. Therefore, the total number of people is a geometric series. But since 847 is not a power of 2 minus 1, there must be something wrong here.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is not about the number of ships over 300 years, but that the monster ate 847 people over 300 years, and each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. Therefore, perhaps the number of people on each ship is not starting from 1, but starting from some other number. Wait, but the problem says \"each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship.\" So, if the first ship has x people, the second has 2x, third has 4x, etc. Therefore, the total is x*(2^n - 1). Therefore, unless there is a miscalculation here, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the fact that 847 isn't a power of 2 minus 1 and instead find x such that the total is 847. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is structured such that over 300 years, the monster ate 847 people, and each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. Therefore, perhaps the number of ships is 3, 4, or something else. Let me try to think of possible n.\n\nLet me suppose that the number of ships is 3.

Hmm, let's start by breaking down the problem step by step. \n\nFirst, Tobias is buying shoes that cost $95. After buying them, he has $15 in change. So, the total amount he had before buying the shoes should be the cost of the shoes plus the change. Let me write that down:\n\nTotal money before buying shoes = Cost of shoes + Change\nTotal money before buying shoes = $95 + $15 = $110.\n\nSo, he had $110 in his account before buying the shoes. Now, he's been saving up each month for three months. Let me check how much he saved each month. He gets a $5 allowance a month and also mows lawns and shovels. \n\nHe mows 4 lawns and shovels some number of driveways. Let me note down the costs:\n\n- Mowing a lawn: $15\n- Shoveling a driveway: $7\n\nSo, if he mows 4 lawns, that's 4 * $15 = $60. If he shovels x driveways, that's x * $7. \n\nBut wait, he also has his allowance. So, his total savings from the allowance and his mowing and shoveling should add up to the $110 he had before buying the shoes. \n\nLet me think. Let's denote the number of driveways he shoveled as x. Then, his total expenses would be:\n\nMowing lawns: 4 * $15 = $60\n\nShoveling driveways: x * $7\n\nSo, total expenses = $60 + $7x\n\nThen, his total money after all expenses would be:\n\nTotal money before expenses + total expenses = $110 + $60 + $7x = $170 + $7x\n\nBut he has $15 in change after buying the shoes. Wait, hold on. Wait, when he buys the shoes, he has $15 in change. So, the total amount he had before buying the shoes is $110, and after buying the shoes, he has $15.

Let me clarify:\n\nHe saves up his money each month. So, over three months, he has saved up $110. Let me check how much he saved each month. \n\nHe gets a $5 allowance each month. So, over three months, that's 3 * $5 = $15. \n\nAdditionally, he mows lawns and shovels. So, he has some amount from his allowance and his mowing/shoveling expenses. \n\nBut maybe I need to consider that his total money after saving up is $110. So, the total money he has is $110. \n\nBut he also has his expenses. Wait, maybe I need to think of his total expenses as the amount he spent on mowing and shoveling plus his allowance. \n\nWait, let me try again. \n\nTotal money he has before buying shoes: $110.\n\nHe saves up his money each month. So, over three months, he has saved up $110. \n\nBut how does that relate to his expenses? Maybe his total expenses are the amount he spent on mowing and shoveling, and his allowance. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to model his total money.

Wait, maybe I need to think of his total money after buying the shoes. \n\nWait, the problem says he has $15 in change after buying the shoes. So, the total amount he spent on the shoes is $95. \n\nTherefore, the total amount he had before buying the shoes is $95 + $15 = $110. \n\nSo, that's correct. \n\nNow, how does this relate to his expenses? \n\nHe has his allowance, mows lawns, and shovels driveways. \n\nLet me think. Let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s say he mows 4 lawns.

Let me try to write equations.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet\u2019s say he mows 4 lawns, so that's 4 * 15 = $60.\n\nLet\u2019s say he shovels x driveways, so that's x * 7 = $7x.\n\nSo, his total expenses are $60 + $7x.\n\nHe also has his allowance. Since he saves up his money each month for three months, his total savings is $15 (from allowance) + $7x (from mowing/shoveling) = $15 + $7x.\n\nBut he has $110 in savings. Therefore:\n\n$15 + $7x = $110\n\nSolving for x:\n\n$7x = $110 - $15 = $95\n\nx = $95 / $7 \u2248 13.57\n\nBut that's not possible because he can't shovel a fraction of a driveway. So, there must be something wrong here.\n\nWait, maybe my assumption is incorrect. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe the total money he has is his savings from allowance plus his expenses. But he has $110 in savings. So:\n\nTotal savings = Savings from allowance + Savings from mowing/shoveling = $110.\n\nBut he also has his expenses. Wait, maybe his total money is:\n\nTotal money = Savings from allowance + Savings from mowing/shoveling + Expenses on shoes.\n\nBut he has $15 in change after buying the shoes. So, total money = $95 (cost of shoes) + $15 (change) = $110.\n\nTherefore, total money = Savings from allowance + Savings from mowing/shoveling + Expenses on shoes = $110.\n\nBut Savings from allowance is $15 (3 months * $5). \n\nExpenses on shoes is $95. \n\nTherefore, Savings from mowing/shoveling + $95 = $110\n\nTherefore, Savings from mowing/shoveling = $110 - $95 = $15.\n\nSo, Savings from mowing/shoveling is $15. \n\nBut Savings from mowing/shoveling is also equal to the amount he spent on mowing and shoveling. \n\nSo, if he mows 4 lawns, that's $60. If he shovels x driveways, that's $7x. \n\nSo, total expenses on mowing and shoveling is $60 + $7x. \n\nBut according to the previous calculation, this total should be equal to $15. \n\nBut $60 + $7x = $15? That would mean $7x = -45, which is impossible. \n\nWait, so clearly, there's a mistake here. \n\nWait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the total money he has is his savings from allowance plus his expenses. But he has $110 in savings. \n\nBut if he saves up $110, that includes his savings from allowance and his savings from mowing/shoveling. \n\nBut he also has his expenses. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that when he saves up his money, he is saving from his allowance and his mowing/shoveling. \n\nBut he also has his expenses. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that he saves up his money each month, so over three months, he has saved up $110. \n\nBut how does that relate to his expenses? \n\nAlternatively, maybe his total money is his savings from allowance plus his expenses. \n\nBut he has $110 in savings. \n\nSo, total money = Savings from allowance + Expenses = $110. \n\nBut he also has his expenses. \n\nWait,", "final_answer": null, "num_tokens": 2048, "num_reasoning_steps": 95, "activations_path": "results_thinking/embeddings/q_0011_06b_activations.npz"}

The problem says he also has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees. Hmm, so I need to figure out how many coconut trees he has and then add them to the mango trees to get the total number of trees.\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again. \"5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees.\" So, \"half as many\" means half of the number of mango trees. Then, \"5 less than that\" would be half of the mango trees minus 5. Let me write that down.\n\nLet me denote the number of mango trees as M. According to the problem, M is 60. Then, the number of coconut trees would be (1/2)*M - 5. Plugging in M = 60, that would be (1/2)*60 - 5. Let me calculate that.\n\n(1/2)*60 is 30, right? Then subtract 5, so 30 - 5 equals 25. Therefore, there are 25 coconut trees.\n\nNow, adding the mango trees (60) and coconut trees (25) together, the total number of trees would be 60 + 25. Let me do that addition. 60 + 25 is 85. So, Randy has 85 trees in total.\n\nWait, let me check if I did that correctly. Let me verify each step again.\n\nNumber of mango trees: 60. Correct.\n\nNumber of coconut trees: half of mango trees minus 5. Half of 60 is 30, minus 5 is 25. Correct.\n\nTotal trees: 60 + 25. Yes, 60 + 25 is indeed 85. Hmm, seems straightforward. Is there any chance I misread the problem? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees.\" So, coconut trees = half of mango trees minus 5. Yes, that's exactly what I did. So, 60 mango trees, 25 coconut trees, total 85. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as coconut trees = (M/2) - 5. So, substituting M = 60, we get (60/2) - 5 = 30 - 5 = 25. Yep, same result. So total trees 60 + 25 = 85. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here.

He buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10, a pound of cream cheese that cost half the price of the cheddar cheese, and a pack of cold cuts that cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese. How much does he spend on the ingredients?", "gold_answer": "35", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Jasper is buying ingredients for his dinner party, and he needs to figure out how much he spends in total. The problem says he buys cheddar cheese, cream cheese, and cold cuts. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the cheddar cheese. He buys 2 pounds for $10. So, the cost per pound of cheddar cheese is $10 divided by 2 pounds. Let me calculate that. 10 divided by 2 is $5 per pound. So, cheddar cheese costs $5 per pound.\n\nNext, the cream cheese. The problem says it costs half the price of the cheddar cheese. Since cheddar cheese is $5 per pound, half of that would be... $5 divided by 2. Let me do that division. 5 divided by 2 is $2.50 per pound. So, the cream cheese costs $2.50 per pound.\n\nThen, the cold cuts. The problem states that the pack of cold cuts costs twice the price of the cheddar cheese. Since cheddar cheese is $5 per pound, twice that would be $10 per pound. So, cold cuts cost $10 per pound.\n\nNow, to find the total cost, I need to add up the costs of all three ingredients. Let me write that down:\n\n- Cheddar cheese: 2 pounds * $5 per pound = $10\n- Cream cheese: 1 pound * $2.50 per pound = $2.50\n- Cold cuts: 1 pack * $10 per pound = $10\n\nAdding those together: $10 (cheddar) + $2.50 (cream) + $10 (cold cuts) equals... let me add them up. 10 plus 2.50 is 12.50, and then adding $10 gives a total of $22.50.\n\nWait, let me check again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, cheddar is 2 pounds for $10. So, 2 divided by 2 is $5 per pound. That seems right. Then cream cheese is half, so $2.50. Cold cuts are twice, so $10. Adding them all: 10 + 2.50 + 10. Yes, that's 22.50. So, the total cost is $22.50.\n\nHmm, I don't think I made any errors here. Let me just verify once more. If I convert everything to cents to avoid decimal confusion, that would be 10 dollars is 1000 cents, 2.50 is 250 cents, and 10 is 1000 cents. Adding them up: 1000 + 250 + 1000 = 2250 cents, which is $22.50. Yep, that matches. So, I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nJasper spends \\boxed{22.50} dollars on the ingredients.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how much Jasper spends on the ingredients, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.\n\n1. **Cheddar Cheese**:  \n   - Cost: $10 for 2 pounds.  \n   - Cost per pound: $10 \u00f7 2 = $5.  \n   - Total cost for cheddar cheese: $2 \\times 5 = \\$10$.\n\n2. **Cream Cheese**:  \n   - Cost: Half the price of cheddar cheese, which is $5.  \n   - Cost per pound: $5 \u00f7 2 = \\$2.50.  \n   - Total cost for cream cheese: $1 \\times 2.50 = \\$2.50$.\n\n3. **Cold Cuts**:  \n   - Cost: Twice the price of cheddar cheese, which is $5.  \n   - Cost per pound: $10.  \n   - Total cost for cold cuts: $1 \\times 10 = \\$10$.\n\nAdding these together:  \n$$\n\\$10 + \\$2.50 + \\$10 = \\$22.50\n$$\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer**:  \nJasper spends $\\boxed{22.50}$ dollars on the ingredients.", "final_answer": "22.50", "num_tokens": 930, "num_reasoning_steps": 30, "activations_path": "results_thinking/embeddings/q_0013_06b_activations.npz"}

How many hours will it take her to read 120 pages?", "gold_answer": "5", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, so Joy can read 8 pages in 20 minutes, and I need to figure out how long it will take her to read 120 pages. Hmm, let me think. \n\nFirst, maybe I should figure out how many pages she reads per minute. If she reads 8 pages in 20 minutes, then dividing 8 by 20 gives me the pages per minute. Let me do that calculation. 8 divided by 20... that's 0.4 pages per minute. Wait, is that right? Yeah, because 20 minutes times 0.4 pages per minute equals 8 pages. Okay, so she reads 0.4 pages each minute.\n\nNow, if I want to find out how many minutes it takes her to read 120 pages, I can divide the total pages by the pages per minute. So 120 divided by 0.4. Let me calculate that. 120 divided by 0.4... Hmm, dividing by 0.4 is the same as multiplying by 2.5 because 1/0.4 is 2.5. So 120 times 2.5 equals... let me do that. 120 times 2 is 240, and 120 times 0.5 is 60, so adding them together gives 300 minutes. \n\nWait, so 300 minutes? But the question asks for hours. So I need to convert minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, I divide 300 by 60. Let me calculate that. 300 divided by 60 is 5 hours. So it would take her 5 hours to read 120 pages. \n\nLet me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, pages per minute: 8 pages / 20 minutes = 0.4 pages per minute. Then total pages: 120. So time = total pages / pages per minute = 120 / 0.4 = 300 minutes. Then convert minutes to hours: 300 / 60 = 5 hours. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it using proportions. If 8 pages take 20 minutes, then 120 pages would take... Let me set up a proportion. The ratio of pages to time is constant. So 8/20 = 120/x, where x is the time in hours. Wait, but maybe I need to convert the time to hours first. \n\nAlternatively, maybe convert 20 minutes to hours first. 20 minutes is 20/60 hours, which is 1/3 hours. Then, if 8 pages take 1/3 hours, then 120 pages would take (120 / 8) * (1/3) hours. Let me compute that. 120 divided by 8 is 15, times 1/3 is 5 hours. Yep, same answer. \n\nSo regardless of the method, I get 5 hours. That seems consistent. I think that's the correct answer. \n\n**Final Answer**\nIt will take Joy \\boxed{5} hours to read 120 pages.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how long it will take Joy to read 120 pages, we begin by analyzing her reading rate.\n\nJoy reads **8 pages in 20 minutes**, which means her reading rate is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{8 \\text{ pages}}{20 \\text{ minutes}} = 0.4 \\text{ pages per minute}\n$$\n\nNow, to find the time required to read 120 pages, we divide the total number of pages by her rate:\n\n$$\n\\frac{120 \\text{ pages}}{0.4 \\text{ pages per minute}} = 300 \\text{ minutes}\n$$\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 300 minutes into hours:\n\n$$\n\\frac{300 \\text{ minutes}}{60} = 5 \\text{ hours}\n$$\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n$$\n\\boxed{5}\n$$", "final_answer": "5", "num_tokens": 916, "num_reasoning_steps": 18, "activations_path": "results_thinking/embeddings/q_0014_06b_activations.npz"}

James is making a media empire, and I need to figure out his profit over 20 weeks. Hmm, let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, he creates a movie for $2000. Each DVD costs him $6 to make. Then he sells it for 2.5 times the cost. So, selling price per DVD would be 2.5 times $2000? Wait, is that right? Let me check. If the cost to make a DVD is $6, and he sells it for 2.5 times that, then yes, selling price is 2.5 * $2000. Let me calculate that. \n\n2.5 times 2000 is... 2000 * 2.5. Well, 2000 * 2 is 4000, and 2000 * 0.5 is 1000, so total is 5000. So selling price per DVD is $5000. \n\nThen he sells 500 movies a day for 5 days a week. Let me confirm that. So 500 movies per day, multiplied by 5 days a week, equals how many movies per week? 500 * 5 = 2500 movies per week. \n\nNow, profit per day? Wait, profit is revenue minus cost. So first, let's find total revenue and total cost. \n\nTotal revenue would be selling price per DVD times number of DVDs sold. Since he sells 500 per day, over 5 days a week, that's 2500 DVDs. So total revenue is 2500 * $5000. Let me calculate that. \n\n2500 * 5000. Hmm, 2500 * 5000. Well, 25 * 5000 is 125,000, and 2500 * 5000 is 125,000,000? Wait, no. Wait, 2500 * 5000. Let me think again. 2500 * 5000. Since 2500 is 2.5 * 1000, and 5000 is 5 * 1000. So multiplying them together, 2.5 * 5 = 12.5, and 1000 * 1000 = 1,000,000. So total revenue is 12,500,000. \n\nTotal cost is the cost to make each DVD times number of DVDs sold. Each DVD costs $6, so total cost is 500 * 6. Let me calculate that. 500 * 6 is 3000. So total cost is $3000 per week? Wait, no. Wait, total cost is per DVD times number of DVDs. So if he sells 500 DVDs a day, over 5 days a week, that's 2500 DVDs. So total cost is 2500 * $6. Let me compute that. 2500 * 6. 2000 * 6 is 12,000, and 500 * 6 is 3,000, so total is 15,000. So total cost is $15,000 per week. \n\nTherefore, profit per week would be total revenue minus total cost. So 12,500,000 - 15,000. Let me subtract. 12,500,000 - 15,000 is 12,485,000. \n\nNow, he wants to know his profit in 20 weeks. So 12,485,000 multiplied by 20. Let me calculate that. \n\nFirst, 12,485,000 * 20. Well, 12,485,000 * 10 is 124,850,000, and 12,485,000 * 10 is another 124,850,000. So total is 249,700,000. \n\nWait, let me check again. 12,485,000 * 20. Yes, 12,485,000 * 2 is 24,970,000, so times 10 is 249,700,000. \n\nBut let me verify all steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, selling price per DVD: 2.5 times cost. Cost is $6, so 2.5 * 6 = $15. Wait, hold on! Wait, earlier I thought selling price was 2.5 times the cost, but maybe I confused that. Wait, hold on. Wait, the problem says \"He sells it for 2.5 times that much.\" So \"that much\" refers to the cost? Or is it the selling price? Wait, let me check again. \n\nOriginal problem: \"He sells it for 2.5 times that much.\" So \"that much\" probably refers to the cost. So selling price is 2.5 times the cost. So if the cost is $6, then selling price is 2.5 * 6 = $15. Wait, but earlier I thought selling price was 2.5 * 2000. Wait, that was a mistake! \n\nOh no! There's a critical mistake here. Let me re-examine. \n\nJames creates a movie for $2000. So that's the cost to make the movie. Then he sells it for 2.5 times that much. So selling price is 2.5 * 2000 = $5000. But if he sells it for 2.5 times the cost, then it's 2.5 * 6 = $15. Which is different. \n\nWait, so which is it? The problem says \"He sells it for 2.5 times that much.\" The wording is a bit ambiguous. Is \"that much\" referring to the cost or the selling price? \n\nIn business terms, usually, when someone says \"sell for X times the cost,\" they mean selling price is X times the cost. So if the cost is $6, selling price is 2.5 * 6 = $15. But if they said \"2.5 times that much,\" maybe they mean 2.5 times the selling price? But that would be confusing. \n\nWait, let me check the original problem again: \"He sells it for 2.5 times that much.\" The key here is \"that much.\" If \"that much\" refers to the cost, then yes, selling price is 2.5 * cost. If it refers to the selling price, then it's 2.5 * selling price. But that would be a different interpretation. \n\nBut given that he creates a movie for $2000, which is the cost to make the movie, and sells it for 2.5 times that much, then \"that much\" is the cost. Therefore, selling price is 2.5 * 2000 = $5000. \n\nBut then why did I think earlier that he sells it for 2.5 times the cost? Because maybe I confused the cost with the selling price. \n\nWait, let me check again. The problem says: \"He creates a movie for $2000. Each DVD cost $6 to make. He sells it for 2.5 times that much.\" \n\nSo \"He sells it for 2.5 times that much.\" So \"that much\" refers to the cost. Therefore, selling price is 2.5 * cost. \n\nBut then, if he sells it for 2.5 times the cost, then the cost is $6, so selling price is 2.5 * 6 = $15. \n\nBut then, why does he create a movie for $2000? That would be the cost to make the movie. So if he sells it for 2.5 times that much, then the selling price is 2.5 * 2000 = $5000. \n\nSo there's a contradiction here. Which is correct? \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that \"He sells it for 2.5 times that much.\" So \"that much\" refers to the cost. Therefore, selling price is 2.5 * cost. \n\nBut then, if he creates a movie for $2000, that would be the cost to make the movie. So selling price is 2.5 times that cost. \n\nBut then, why does he mention \"Each DVD cost $6 to make\"? Maybe that's the cost per DVD, not the total cost. \n\nWait, maybe there's a translation issue or wording issue. Let me think again. \n\nOriginal problem: \"He creates a movie for $2000. Each DVD cost $6 to make.

{"question_id": "q_0016", "model_name": "qwen3-0.6b", "model_params": "0.6B", "question": "The profit from a business transaction is shared among 2 business partners, Mike and Johnson in the ratio 2:5 respectively. If Johnson got $2500, how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?", "gold_answer": "800", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. So, the problem is about sharing profit between Mike and Johnson in the ratio 2:5. Johnson got $2500, and I need to figure out how much Mike will have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total profit. Since the profit is shared in the ratio 2:5 between Mike and Johnson, that means the total profit is divided into 2 parts for Mike and 5 parts for Johnson. So, the ratio of Mike's share to Johnson's share is 2:5. \n\nWait, but they mentioned that Johnson got $2500. So, if the ratio is 2:5, then the total parts are 2 + 5 = 7 parts. Therefore, each part is equal to 2500 divided by 7. Let me calculate that. \n\n2500 divided by 7... Let me do that division. 7 times 350 is 2450, so 2500 minus 2450 is 50. So, each part is 350 + 50/7, which is 350 + 7.142... So approximately $357.14 per part. Wait, but maybe I should keep it as a fraction for accuracy. \n\nSo, each part is 2500/7. Therefore, Mike's share is 2*(2500/7) and Johnson's is 5*(2500/7). Let me confirm that. Yes, since the ratio is 2:5, Mike gets 2 parts and Johnson gets 5 parts. \n\nSo, Mike's total profit would be 2*(2500/7) = 5000/7 dollars. Let me compute that. 5000 divided by 7 is approximately 714.29. So, Mike's share is approximately $714.29. \n\nBut wait, the problem says that Mike will spend some of his share on a shirt that costs $200. So, after spending $200, how much does Mike have left? \n\nSo, first, Mike's total share is 5000/7. Then, he spends $200 on the shirt. Therefore, the remaining amount would be 5000/7 - 200. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, convert 200 to a fraction with denominator 7. 200 is 1400/7. Therefore, 5000/7 - 1400/7 = (5000 - 1400)/7 = 3600/7. \n\nNow, 3600 divided by 7. Let me compute that. 7 times 514 is 3598, so 3600/7 is approximately 514.29. \n\nTherefore, Mike will have approximately $514.29 left after spending $200 on the shirt. \n\nBut let me check if I did everything correctly. \n\nFirst, total profit is divided into 7 parts. Since Johnson has 5 parts and he gets $2500, each part is 2500/7. Then Mike's share is 2*(2500/7). Then subtracting $200 from that gives the remaining amount. \n\nYes, that seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total profit first. Let me try that approach. \n\nIf the ratio is 2:5, then the total profit is 2x + 5x = 7x. Since Johnson has 5x = 2500, then x = 2500/5 = 500. Therefore, total profit is 7*500 = 3500. \n\nTherefore, Mike's share is 2x = 1000. Then, spending $200 on the shirt, Mike has 1000 - 200 = 800 left. \n\nWait, hold on! Wait, this is conflicting with my previous answer. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, so here, if total profit is 3500, then Mike's share is 1000. Then subtracting $200 gives 800. But earlier, when I calculated each part as 2500/7, I had Mike's share as 5000/7 \u2248 714.29. Which is different. \n\nSo, which is correct? There's a discrepancy here. Let me check again. \n\nFirst approach: total profit is 7x, where x is each part. Since 5x = 2500, x = 500. Therefore, total profit is 7*500 = 3500. Therefore, Mike's share is 2x = 1000. \n\nSecond approach: each part is 2500/7 \u2248 357.14. Therefore, Mike's share is 2*(2500/7) \u2248 5000/7 \u2248 714.29. \n\nBut these two results are different. Which one is correct? \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the first approach. Let me check again. \n\nIf the ratio is 2:5, then Mike's share is 2 parts, Johnson's is 5 parts. So, total parts are 7. \n\nIf Johnson's share is 5 parts, and he gets $2500, then each part is 2500/5 = 500. Therefore, total profit is 7*500 = 3500. Therefore, Mike's share is 2*500 = 1000. \n\nBut then, why does the other approach give a different result? Because in the first approach, I thought each part is 2500/7, but that would be if the ratio was 2:5, but actually, if the ratio is 2:5, then the total parts are 7, so each part is 2500 divided by 7. But here, if the ratio is 2:5, and the total is 3500, then each part is 500. \n\nWait, so there's a contradiction here. Which is correct? \n\nWait, let me think again. The ratio is 2:5. So, Mike:Johnson = 2:5. Therefore, the total parts are 2 + 5 = 7. Therefore, the total profit is 7 parts. \n\nIf Johnson's share is 5 parts, and he gets $2500, then each part is 2500 / 5 = 500. Therefore, total profit is 7*500 = 3500. Therefore, Mike's share is 2*500 = 1000. \n\nBut then, why did I think earlier that each part is 2500/7? Because if I thought that the ratio is 2:5, then the total profit is 2x + 5x = 7x, so x is 2500/7. But that would be if the ratio is 2:5, but that would mean that the total profit is 2x + 5x = 7x, but if x is 2500/7, then total profit is 7*(2500/7) = 2500. But that contradicts the previous result. \n\nWait, so there's confusion here. Let me clarify. \n\nThe ratio is 2:5. So, Mike gets 2 parts, Johnson gets 5 parts. Therefore, the total parts are 7. \n\nIf Johnson's share is 5 parts, and he gets $2500, then each part is 2500 / 5 = 500. Therefore, total profit is 7*500 = 3500. Therefore, Mike's share is 2*500 = 1000. \n\nAlternatively, if I think that the ratio is 2:5, then the total profit is 2x + 5x = 7x. Therefore, if Johnson's share is 5x = 2500, then x = 500, so total profit is 7*500 = 3500. Therefore, Mike's share is 2x = 1000. \n\nBut then why did I think earlier that each part is 2500/7? Because if I thought that the ratio is 2:5, then the total profit is 2x + 5x = 7x, so x is 2500/7. But that would be if the total profit is 2500. But that's not the case here. \n\nWait, so there's a mistake here. If the ratio is 2:5, and the total profit is 2500, then each part is 2500/7. But if the total profit is 3500, then each part is 500. \n\nTherefore, which is correct", "final_answer": null, "num_tokens": 2048, "num_reasoning_steps": 38, "activations_path": "results_thinking/embeddings/q_0016_06b_activations.npz"}

I need to figure out how many hard hats are left in the truck after Carl and John take some away. Let me start by listing out the initial numbers. There are 26 pink, 15 green, and 24 yellow hard hats. \n\nFirst, Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats. So, I need to subtract 4 from the pink hats. Let me do that: 26 minus 4. That gives me 22 pink hard hats left. \n\nNext, John takes away 6 pink hard hats and twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink he took. Wait, the problem says \"twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats that he removed.\" So, if Carl took 6 pink, then John took 6 pink and twice that, which would be 12 green. \n\nSo, John took 6 pink and 12 green. Let me check that. 6 pink and 12 green. Let me add those together. 6 + 12 is 18. So, John took 18 hard hats in total. \n\nNow, I need to subtract the ones taken by both Carl and John from the original total. Let me add up all the hard hats first. The original total is 26 pink + 15 green + 24 yellow. Let me calculate that. \n\n26 + 15 is 41, plus 24 is 65. So, there are 65 hard hats initially. \n\nNow, subtract the ones taken. Carl took 4 pink, which is 4. John took 6 pink and 12 green. So, total taken is 4 + 6 + 12 = 22. \n\nWait, let me confirm. 4 pink, 6 pink, and 12 green. So, 4 + 6 is 10, plus 12 is 22. Yes, that's correct. \n\nSo, total remaining is 65 minus 22. Let me do that subtraction. 65 - 22 is 43. \n\nWait, hold on. Let me check again. Original total is 26 + 15 + 24. Let me recalculate that. 26 + 15 is 41, plus 24 is 65. Correct. Then subtract 22. 65 - 22 is 43. \n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the steps. Let me go through each part again. \n\nFirst, initial counts: 26 pink, 15 green, 24 yellow. \n\nCarl takes 4 pink: 26 - 4 = 22. \n\nJohn takes 6 pink and twice as many green as the number of pink he took. So, 6 pink, twice that is 12 green. So, 6 + 12 = 18. \n\nTotal taken: 4 + 6 + 12 = 22. \n\nTotal remaining: 65 - 22 = 43. \n\nHmm, seems straightforward. But let me check if there's any chance I misread the problem. \n\nThe problem says \"twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats that he removed.\" So, if he removed 6 pink, then he removes 6*2=12 green. That's correct. \n\nSo, yes, 6 pink and 12 green. \n\nTherefore, total taken is 4 + 6 + 12 = 22. \n\nOriginal total is 26 + 15 + 24 = 65. \n\n65 - 22 = 43. \n\nSo, the answer should be 43. \n\nWait, but let me check once more. Maybe I made a mistake in the arithmetic. \n\n26 - 4 is 22. Correct. \n\nThen 6 + 12 is 18. Correct. \n\nTotal taken is 4 + 6 + 18? Wait, no. Wait, total taken is 4 (from Carl) + 6 (from John) + 12 (from John). So, 4 + 6 is 10, plus 12 is 22. Yes. \n\nOriginal total is 65. 65 - 22 is 43. \n\nYes, that seems right. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the total number of hard hats remaining is 43.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe total number of hard hats remaining in the truck is \\boxed{43}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many hard hats remain in the truck after Carl and John take some away, we begin by calculating the initial total number of hard hats:\n\n- **Pink hard hats**: 26  \n- **Green hard hats**: 15  \n- **Yellow hard hats**: 24  \n\n**Total initial hard hats**:  \n$$\n26 + 15 + 24 = 65\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Carl's Action\n\nCarl takes **4 pink hard hats**.  \n$$\n26 - 4 = 22\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: John's Action\n\nJohn takes:\n- **6 pink hard hats**  \n- **Twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink he took**:  \n  $$\n  6 \\times 2 = 12\n  $$\n\nSo, John takes:\n- **6 pink**  \n- **12 green**\n\n**Total hard hats taken by John**:  \n$$\n6 + 12 = 18\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Total Hard Hats Taken\n\n$$\n4 \\text{ (Carl)} + 18 \\text{ (John)} = 22\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Remaining Hard Hats\n\n$$\n65 - 22 = 43\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{43}\n$$", "final_answer": "43", "num_tokens": 1298, "num_reasoning_steps": 56, "activations_path": "results_thinking/embeddings/q_0017_06b_activations.npz"}

So, Roque needs to get to work, and he can either walk or bike. The problem says he walks to and from work three times a week and bikes twice. Also, walking takes two hours each way, and biking takes one hour each way. The question is asking how many hours he takes in total to get to and from work a week with both walking and biking.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. First, I need to calculate the total time he spends walking and the total time he spends biking. Then add those two totals together. \n\nStarting with walking. He walks to and from work three times a week. Each trip takes two hours. So, for walking, it's 3 trips multiplied by 2 hours per trip. Let me calculate that. 3 times 2 is 6 hours. So, walking takes 6 hours total per week.\n\nNow for biking. He bikes to and from work twice a week. Each trip takes one hour. So, two trips times one hour per trip is 2 hours. Therefore, biking takes 2 hours per week.\n\nAdding both times together: 6 hours (walking) plus 2 hours (biking) equals 8 hours. \n\nWait, let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Walking three times: 3*2=6. Biking twice: 2*1=2. Total 6+2=8. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nIs there anything else I need to consider? The problem says \"to and from work,\" so each trip is one way, but since he does it three times and twice, it's just adding the hours for each trip.

Tim bikes his bike back and forth to work each day, and also goes on a weekend ride of 200 miles. His work is 20 miles away, so each day he goes to work and back. Wait, does that mean he goes 20 miles to work and 20 miles back? So total distance for one day is 20 + 20 = 40 miles? But then he also has a weekend ride of 200 miles. So total distance for the week would be 40 miles per day times 5 days plus 200 miles for the weekend? Let me check that again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"he rides his bike back and forth to work for each of his 5 workdays.\" So each workday, he goes to work and comes back. So that's 20 miles to work and 20 miles back. So per day, 40 miles. Then he also goes on a weekend bike ride of 200 miles. So total distance for the week would be 5 days * 40 miles + 200 miles. Let me calculate that. 5*40 is 200, plus 200 is 400 miles total. So total distance is 400 miles. Then he can bike at 25 mph. So time is distance divided by speed. So 400 miles divided by 25 mph. Let me compute that. 400 divided by 25. Well, 25*16 is 400, so 16 hours. So the answer should be 16 hours. Let me check again.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake with the weekend ride. The problem says \"he also goes for a weekend bike ride of 200 miles.\" So that's separate from the work days. So total distance is 5*40 + 200 = 200 + 200 = 400 miles. Divided by 25 mph gives 16 hours. Yeah, that seems right. So the answer is 16 hours. I think that's it.

The problem says she bought 11 snowflake stamps. Then she bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Hmm, so if she has 11 snowflake, then the truck stamps would be 11 + 9? Let me check that. Yeah, 9 more than 11 is 20. So truck stamps are 20. \n\nNow, she bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So truck stamps are 20, so rose stamps would be 20 - 13? Let me calculate that. 20 minus 13 is 7. So rose stamps are 7. \n\nNow, to find the total number of stamps, I need to add up all three: snowflake, truck, and rose. So that would be 11 (snowflake) + 20 (truck) + 7 (rose). Let me add those numbers. 11 plus 20 is 31, and then plus 7 is 38. So total stamps are 38? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, snowflake is 11. Truck is 11 + 9 = 20. Rose is 20 - 13 = 7. Adding them up: 11 + 20 is 31, plus 7 is 38. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me verify each step again. The problem says \"9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps.\" So truck = snowflake + 9. 11 + 9 is 20.

I need to figure out how many beetles are eaten each day based on the given information. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says each bird eats 12 beetles per day. Then, each snake eats 3 birds per day. And each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day. There are 6 jaguars in the forest. So, I need to find the total number of beetles eaten each day.\n\nHmm, maybe I should start by finding out how many birds are eaten by each jaguar. Since each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day, and each snake eats 3 birds per day, I can find out how many birds each jaguar eats. Let me write that down:\n\nNumber of birds eaten by each jaguar = snakes eaten by jaguar * birds eaten by each snake.\n\nSo, snakes eaten by jaguar = 5 snakes per day. Birds eaten by each snake = 3 birds per day. Therefore, birds eaten by each jaguar = 5 * 3 = 15 birds per day.\n\nWait, so each jaguar eats 15 birds per day? Let me check that again. If each snake eats 3 birds, then 5 snakes would eat 5*3=15 birds. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, since there are 6 jaguars, the total number of birds eaten by all jaguars would be 6 jaguars * 15 birds per jaguar = 90 birds per day. Okay, so 90 birds are eaten each day by the jaguars.\n\nBut wait, the problem says each bird eats 12 beetles per day. So, if there are 90 birds eaten by jaguars, then the total beetles eaten would be 90 birds * 12 beetles per bird. Let me calculate that: 90*12. Hmm, 90*10=900, 90*2=180, so total is 900+180=1080 beetles. So, 1080 beetles eaten each day?\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any steps. Let me go through it again.\n\nFirst, jaguars eat 5 snakes per day. Each snake eats 3 birds per day. So, 5*3=15 birds per day. 6 jaguars * 15 birds = 90 birds. Then, each bird eats 12 beetles per day. So, 90 birds * 12 beetles = 1080 beetles. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it by considering beetles eaten by each animal. Let me try another way.\n\nFirst, find out how many beetles are eaten by each bird. Each bird eats 12 beetles. So, if there are 90 birds eaten by jaguars, then total beetles would be 90*12. Which is again 1080. So, same answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the number of beetles eaten by snakes first, then by jaguars, and then by birds. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, snakes eat 3 birds per day. So, if there are 90 birds eaten by jaguars, then snakes would eat 90 birds. Each snake eats 3 birds, so total snakes eaten would be 90/3=30 snakes per day. Then, each jaguar eats 5 snakes, so total jaguars eaten snakes would be 6 jaguars * 5 snakes = 30 snakes. Which matches. Then, each snake eats 12 beetles per day, so total beetles eaten by snakes would be 30 snakes * 12 beetles = 360 beetles. Then, total beetles eaten by birds would be 90 birds * 12 beetles = 1080 beetles. So, total beetles eaten is 360 + 1080 = 1440 beetles? Wait, hold on, that contradicts my previous answer. Wait, why?\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, if beetles are eaten by birds, snakes, and jaguars. So, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says each bird eats 12 beetles per day. So, beetles eaten by birds is 90*12=1080. Then, beetles eaten by snakes: snakes eat 3 birds per day, so snakes eat 90 birds, so beetles eaten by snakes is 90*12=1080? Wait, but that would mean beetles eaten by snakes is same as beetles eaten by birds? That can't be. Wait, no, maybe I confused the numbers.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird eats 12 beetles per day. So, beetles eaten by birds: 90*12=1080.\n\nEach snake eats 3 birds per day. So, beetles eaten by snakes: snakes eat 3 birds per day, so beetles eaten by snakes is 3 birds * 12 beetles per bird = 36 beetles per day. Wait, but earlier I thought beetles eaten by snakes is 90*12. But that would be wrong. Because beetles are eaten by snakes, not birds. So, beetles eaten by snakes is 3 birds * 12 beetles = 36 beetles per day. Then, beetles eaten by jaguars: jaguars eat 5 snakes per day, so beetles eaten by jaguars is 5 snakes * 12 beetles per snake = 60 beetles per day. Then total beetles eaten is 1080 (birds) + 36 (snakes) + 60 (jaguars) = 1176 beetles. Wait, but earlier I thought beetles eaten by snakes was 90*12, which was wrong. So, that's where the confusion was. So, the correct way is:\n\nFirst, calculate beetles eaten by birds: 90*12=1080.\n\nThen, beetles eaten by snakes: 3 birds * 12 beetles = 36.\n\nThen, beetles eaten by jaguars: 5 snakes * 12 beetles = 60.\n\nTotal beetles eaten: 1080 + 36 + 60 = 1176 beetles.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought beetles eaten by snakes was 90*12, that was wrong. So, that was my mistake. So, the correct answer is 1176 beetles.\n\nBut let me check again. Let me start over.\n\nFirst, find out how many beetles are eaten by each animal:\n\nBirds: 90 birds * 12 beetles = 1080.\n\nSnakes: 3 birds per day. So, if 90 birds are eaten by jaguars, then snakes eat 90 birds. Therefore, beetles eaten by snakes: 90 birds * 12 beetles = 1080. Wait, but that would mean beetles eaten by snakes is same as beetles eaten by birds. But that can't be. Wait, why?\n\nWait, maybe I confused the numbers. Let me check again. The problem says:\n\nEach bird eats 12 beetles per day. So, beetles eaten by birds is 90*12=1080.\n\nEach snake eats 3 birds per day. So, beetles eaten by snakes is 3 birds * 12 beetles = 36 beetles per day.\n\nEach jaguar eats 5 snakes per day. So, beetles eaten by jaguars is 5 snakes * 12 beetles = 60 beetles per day.\n\nTherefore, total beetles eaten is 1080 + 36 + 60 = 1176 beetles.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, my initial mistake was thinking that beetles eaten by snakes was 90*12, but actually, beetles eaten by snakes is 3 birds * 12 beetles, not 90*12. So, that was the error.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 1176 beetles.\n\nBut let me check once more with another approach.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nFirst, find the number of beetles eaten by each animal:\n\nBirds: 90 * 12 = 1080.\n\nSnakes: 3 birds per day. So, if 90 birds are eaten by jaguars, then snakes eat 90 birds. Therefore, beetles eaten by snakes: 90 * 12 = 1080.\n\nJaguars: 5 snakes per day. So, beetles eaten by jaguars: 5 * 12 = 60.\n\nTotal beetles: 1080 + 1080 + 60 = 2220? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, no, that would be adding beetles eaten by birds and snakes and jaguars. But beetles eaten by snakes is 1080, which is same as beetles eaten by birds. So, total beetles would be 1080 + 1080 + 60 = 2220? But that seems high.

How many letters are in Samantha\u2019s last name?", "gold_answer": "7", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how many letters are in Samantha's last name. Hmm, the problem says that Samantha's last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie's. Then, if Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice as long as Jamie's. Jamie's full name is Jamie Grey. So, first, I need to find out how many letters Jamie's last name has, right? Because Jamie's name is Jamie Grey, so let me break that down.\n\nJamie's full name is Jamie Grey. Let me count the letters. Jamie has three letters: J, A, M. Then Grey is two letters: G, R, E. Wait, but Jamie Grey is a full name, so maybe the last name is Grey? So Jamie's last name is Grey, which is two letters. But wait, the problem says Jamie's full name is Jamie Grey. So maybe Jamie's last name is Grey, which is two letters. So Jamie's last name has two letters. Then, if Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice as long as Jamie's. So Jamie's last name is two letters, so twice that would be four letters. Therefore, Bobbie's last name would be four letters long. \n\nBut let me check again. The problem says \"If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie\u2019s.\" So Jamie's last name is two letters, so Bobbie's last name would be 2 * 2 = 4 letters. Therefore, Bobbie's last name has four letters. \n\nNow, Samantha's last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie's. So if Bobbie's last name is four letters, then Samantha's last name would be 4 - 3 = 1 letter? Wait, that seems too short. But maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe Jamie's last name is longer than two letters? Let me check again. Jamie's full name is Jamie Grey. So Jamie's last name is Grey. Let me count the letters in Grey. G, R, E. That's three letters. So Jamie's last name is three letters. Then, if Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice as long as Jamie's. So Jamie's last name is three letters, so twice that would be six letters. Therefore, Bobbie's last name would be six letters. \n\nBut then, Samantha's last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie's. So if Bobbie's last name is six letters, Samantha's would be 6 - 3 = 3 letters. So Samantha's last name has three letters. Is that correct? Let me verify again step by step.\n\nFirst, Jamie's full name is Jamie Grey. Let's break down the last name. Jamie's last name is Grey. Let's count the letters in Grey: G, R, E. That's three letters. So Jamie's last name has three letters. Then, if Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice as long as Jamie's. So Jamie's last name is three letters, so twice that is six letters. Therefore, Bobbie's last name is six letters. Therefore, Samantha's last name is six minus three letters, which is three letters. So the answer should be three letters. \n\nBut let me check if there's another way to interpret the problem. Maybe Jamie's full name is Jamie Grey, so Jamie's last name is Grey, which is three letters. Then, if Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice as long as Jamie's. So Jamie's last name is three letters, so twice that is six letters. Therefore, Bobbie's last name is six letters. Therefore, Samantha's last name is six minus three letters, which is three letters. So the answer is three letters. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscounted the letters in Jamie's last name. Let me check again. Jamie is J, A, M, and then Grey is G, R, E. So the full name is Jamie Grey, so the last name is Grey. So Grey has three letters. So Jamie's last name is three letters. Therefore, twice that is six letters. Therefore, Bobbie's last name is six letters. Therefore, Samantha's last name is six minus three letters, which is three letters. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be three letters. Let me check once more. \n\nSamantha's last name: Let's call it S. Bobbie's last name: B. According to the problem, S has three fewer letters than B. So B = S + 3. Then, if Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice as long as Jamie's. Jamie's last name is three letters, so twice that is six letters. Therefore, Bobbie's last name would be B = 6. Therefore, S = 6 - 3 = 3. So Samantha's last name has three letters. \n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is three letters. So \\boxed{3}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{3}\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many letters are in Samantha\u2019s last name, we begin by analyzing the information provided:\n\n1. **Jamie\u2019s full name is Jamie Grey**, and we are told that Jamie\u2019s last name has **three letters**.  \n   - Jamie\u2019s last name: **Grey** (G, R, E) \u2192 3 letters.\n\n2. **If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie\u2019s**.  \n   - Jamie\u2019s last name is 3 letters long, so twice that would be **6 letters**.  \n   - Therefore, Bobbie\u2019s last name would be **6 letters** long.\n\n3. **Samantha\u2019s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie\u2019s**.  \n   - Since Bobbie\u2019s last name is 6 letters, Samantha\u2019s last name is $6 - 3 = 3$ letters long.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n$$\n\\boxed{3}\n$$", "final_answer": "3", "num_tokens": 1308, "num_reasoning_steps": 22, "activations_path": "results_thinking/embeddings/q_0022_06b_activations.npz"}

How much did each top cost?", "gold_answer": "5", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Ann bought some items at her favorite store, and I need to figure out the cost of each top. Hmm, let me start by writing down what I know.\n\nFirst, she bought 5 pairs of shorts for $7 each. So, the total cost for the shorts is 5 multiplied by 7. Let me calculate that. 5 times 7 is 35. So, the shorts cost $35.\n\nThen, she bought 2 pairs of shoes for $10 each. So, that's 2 times 10. Let me do that multiplication. 2 times 10 is 20. So, the shoes cost $20.\n\nNow, she also bought 4 tops, all at the same price. Let me call the price of each top 'x'. So, the total cost for the tops would be 4 times x. But wait, I don't know the total cost yet. Maybe I need to add up all the items first?\n\nLet me check. The total cost for the shorts and shoes is 35 + 20, which is $55. Then, the tops cost 4x. But I don't know the total amount she spent. Wait, maybe I need to find the total amount she spent and then divide by 4 to find x?\n\nBut hold on, the problem says she bought 5 shorts, 2 shoes, and 4 tops. But does it mention the total amount she spent? The problem says she bought them for $75. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"For $75 she bought 5 pairs of shorts for $7 each and 2 pairs of shoes for $10 each. She also bought 4 tops, all at the same price. How much did each top cost?\"\n\nSo, the total amount she spent is $75. So, the total cost of all items is $75. Therefore, the total cost of the shorts, shoes, and tops should add up to $75.\n\nSo, let me recast that. The total cost is:\n\nCost of shorts + cost of shoes + cost of tops = 75.\n\nWe already calculated the cost of shorts and shoes:\n\nCost of shorts: 5 * 7 = 35.\n\nCost of shoes: 2 * 10 = 20.\n\nSo, total so far is 35 + 20 = 55. Then, the cost of the tops is 4x, which we don't know yet. So, 55 + 4x = 75. Therefore, solving for x:\n\n4x = 75 - 55 = 20.\n\nTherefore, x = 20 / 4 = 5.\n\nSo, each top costs $5.\n\nWait, let me check again. If each top is $5, then 4 tops would be 4*5 = 20, which matches the remaining amount. And 35 shorts and 20 shoes add up to 55, plus 20 tops is 75, which is exactly the total she spent. So that seems correct.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the arithmetic. Let me recalculate:\n\n5 pairs of shorts at $7 each: 5*7 = 35. Correct.\n\n2 pairs of shoes at $10 each: 2*10 = 20. Correct.\n\nTotal so far: 35 + 20 = 55. Correct.\n\nTotal amount spent: 75. So, 75 - 55 = 20. Divided by 4 tops: 20/4 = 5. Correct.\n\nTherefore, each top costs $5.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any errors in my reasoning. The key was to add up all the items first, then figure out the remaining amount for the tops. Since the total is $75, subtracting the shorts and shoes gives the tops' cost. Dividing by 4 gives the price per top.\n\n**Final Answer**\nEach top cost \\boxed{5} dollars.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the cost of each top, we start by analyzing the total amount Ann spent and the individual items she purchased.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the shorts and shoes\n\n- **Shorts**:  \n  $ 5 \\text{ pairs} \\times \\$7 \\text{ each} = \\$35 $\n\n- **Shoes**:  \n  $ 2 \\text{ pairs} \\times \\$10 \\text{ each} = \\$20 $\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Add the costs of the shorts and shoes\n\n$$\n\\$35 + \\$20 = \\$55\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Determine the cost of the tops\n\nLet the cost of each top be $ x $.

The question is asking how many tennis balls Ralph did not hit in total. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many balls he hit in total, and then subtract that from the total number of balls to get the ones he didn't hit. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nStarting with the first part: 100 balls. He hits 2/5 of them. To find out how many he hit in the first 100, I should calculate 2/5 of 100. Let me do that. 100 divided by 5 is 20, and then multiplied by 2 gives 40. So, 40 balls were hit in the first 100.\n\nNext, the next 75 balls. He hits 1/3 of them. Let me calculate 1/3 of 75. Well, 75 divided by 3 is 25. So, 25 balls were hit in the next 75.\n\nNow, adding those two together: 40 (from first 100) plus 25 (from next 75) equals 65. So, total balls hit are 65. \n\nThe total number of balls Ralph started with is 175. Therefore, the number of balls he did not hit is 175 minus 65. Let me compute that. 175 minus 65 is... 110. \n\nWait, let me check again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, 2/5 of 100 is indeed 40. Then 1/3 of 75 is 25. Adding them gives 65. Total balls 175, so 175 - 65 = 110. That seems right. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me verify the fractions again. For the first 100 balls, 2/5. 100 divided by 5 is 20, times 2 is 40. Correct. For the next 75, 1/3. 75 divided by 3 is 25. Correct. So total hit is 65. Total balls 175. 175 - 65 is 110. \n\nHmm, seems straightforward. I don't see any errors here. Maybe I can check with another approach. Let's think about the total number of balls hit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of balls hit in each part separately and then add.

He wants to get some salt to season his fish, and he wants to know how much salt he'll get when all the water evaporates. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how much salt is in the 2 liters of seawater. Since it's 20% salt, that means 20% of the total volume is salt. So, if I calculate 20% of 2 liters, that should give me the amount of salt. Let me write that down:\n\nSalt = 20% of 2 liters.\n\nConverting 20% to a decimal, that's 0.20. So, 0.20 multiplied by 2 liters equals... 0.4 liters. So, there's 0.4 liters of salt in the bucket. But wait, the question asks for the amount in milliliters. So, I need to convert liters to milliliters. Since 1 liter is 1000 milliliters, 0.4 liters would be 0.4 * 1000 = 400 milliliters. So, Jack would get 400 milliliters of salt when all the water evaporates.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The original volume is 2 liters, 20% salt. So, 20% of 2 liters is indeed 0.4 liters. Converting that to milliliters is straightforward. 0.4 * 1000 = 400. Yep, that seems right.\n\nWait, is there any chance that the question is referring to something else? Like, maybe the bucket is not 2 liters but something else? But the problem says he collects 2 liters of seawater. So, I think my calculation is correct. \n\nAnother way to think about it: if the water is 20% salt, then each liter of seawater has 0.2 liters of salt. So, 2 liters would have 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 liters of salt. Which again is 400 milliliters. \n\nI don't see any other factors here. The problem is straightforward once you convert percentages to decimals and units.

He downloaded 400 more files but again realized that 3/5 of them were irrelevant.\" So, after deleting 70% of the first 800, he downloaded 400 more. Then, he realized that 3/5 of those 400 were irrelevant. So, does he delete 3/5 of the 400? Or does he delete 70% of the first 800, then add 400, then delete 3/5 of the 400?\n\nThe wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me check again. \"He downloaded 800 files, he deleted 70% of them because they were not helpful. He downloaded 400 more files but again realized that 3/5 of them were irrelevant.\" So, after deleting 70% of the first 800, he downloaded 400 more. Then, he realized that 3/5 of those 400 were irrelevant. So, does he delete 3/5 of the 400? Or does he delete 70% of the 400? The problem says \"again realized that 3/5 of them were irrelevant.\" So, maybe he deletes 3/5 of the 400. But the question is about how many valuable files he was left with after deleting the unrelated files in the second round. So, after deleting 70% of the first 800, he had 240 valuable files. Then, he downloaded 400 more, but realized 3/5 were irrelevant. So, does he delete 3/5 of the 400? If so, then he would have 240 + 400 - (3/5 of 400). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 3/5 of 400 is 240. So, if he deletes 240, then he has 240 + 400 - 240 = 400 valuable files. But wait, does he delete 3/5 of the 400? Or does he delete 70% of the 400? The problem says \"again realized that 3/5 of them were irrelevant.\" So, maybe he deletes 3/5 of the 400. Therefore, the total valuable files would be 240 (from first round) plus 400 (downloaded) minus 240 (deleted). So, 240 + 400 - 240 = 400. Therefore, he is left with 400 valuable files.\n\nBut let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me go step by step.\n\nFirst, initial files: 800. He deletes 70%: 800 * 0.7 = 560. So, remaining: 800 - 560 = 240. So, 240 valuable files.\n\nThen, he downloads 400 more. Now, he realizes that 3/5 of them are irrelevant. So, 3/5 of 400 is 240. So, he adds 240 irrelevant files. But does he delete those 240? The problem says \"he deleted 70% of them because they were not helpful. He downloaded 400 more files but again realized that 3/5 of them were irrelevant.\" So, maybe after downloading 400, he deletes 3/5 of them? So, 240. Therefore, total files left: 240 (from first round) + 400 (downloaded) - 240 (deleted) = 400. So, 400 valuable files.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he deletes 70% of the 400? But the problem says \"again realized that 3/5 of them were irrelevant.\" So, maybe he deletes 3/5 of the 400. Therefore, the answer is 400.\n\nBut let me check once more. Maybe there's a different interpretation. Suppose that after deleting 70% of the first 800, he downloads 400 more, and then he deletes 3/5 of the 400. So, total files: 240 + 400 - (3/5 * 400). Which is 240 + 400 - 240 = 400. So, same answer.\n\nAlternatively, if he deletes 70% of the 400, then 0.7 * 400 = 280. Then, total files would be 240 + 400 - 280 = 360. But the problem says he \"again realized that 3/5 of them were irrelevant.\" So, maybe he deletes 3/5 of the 400. Therefore, 240. So, answer is 400.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that after deleting 70% of the first 800, he downloads 400 more, and then he deletes 3/5 of the 400. So, 240. Therefore, 240 + 400 - 240 = 400. So, 400 valuable files.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 400. Let me check once more with numbers.\n\nFirst round: 800 files. 70% deleted: 560. Remaining: 240.\n\nSecond round: 400 files downloaded. 3/5 irrelevant: 240. So, he has 240 + 400 - 240 = 400. Yes. So, the answer is 400. Therefore, \\boxed{400}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{400}\n</think>\n\nBrennan began by downloading 800 files.

If there are a total of 20 gnomes on the street, how many gnomes does the fifth house have?", "gold_answer": "8", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. There are 5 houses on a street, and each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes in the garden. The total number of gnomes on the street is 20. I need to find out how many gnomes the fifth house has. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know there are 5 houses in total. The first four houses each have 3 gnomes. So, maybe I can calculate the total number of gnomes in the first four houses first, and then figure out how many are left for the fifth house. Let me check that.\n\nIf each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes, then the total number of gnomes in those four houses would be 3 multiplied by 4. Let me do that calculation. 3 times 4 is 12. So, there are 12 gnomes in the first four houses. \n\nNow, the total number of gnomes on the street is given as 20. That means the fifth house must have the remaining gnomes. To find that, I can subtract the 12 gnomes from the total 20. Let me write that out: 20 minus 12 equals 8. So, the fifth house has 8 gnomes. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. Let me verify again. First four houses: 3 gnomes each. 4 houses times 3 is indeed 12. Total gnomes: 20. So, 20 minus 12 is 8. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as 20 divided by 5 houses. If there are 5 houses, and each has 3 gnomes, then 20 divided by 5 is 4. But that would mean each house has 4 gnomes, which contradicts the given information that the first four houses have 3. Wait, hold on, that seems conflicting. Let me check that again. \n\nIf there are 5 houses, and each has 3 gnomes, then total would be 5 times 3, which is 15. But the problem says the total is 20. So, there's a discrepancy here. But the problem says that the first four houses have 3 each, and the total is 20. So, maybe the fifth house has 20 minus 12, which is 8. \n\nSo, maybe my initial calculation is correct. Let me think again. The problem says \"each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes in the garden.\" So, that's 4 houses times 3, which is 12. Then, the fifth house has 20 minus 12, which is 8. Therefore, the answer should be 8. \n\nBut let me check once more. If I add up all the houses: 3 (first) + 3 (second) + 3 (third) + 3 (fourth) + 8 (fifth) = 3+3+3+3+8. Let's compute that: 3+3 is 6, plus another 3 is 9, plus another 3 is 12, plus 8 is 20. Perfect, that adds up. So, yes, the fifth house has 8 gnomes. \n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. The key was to figure out how many gnomes are in the first four houses and then subtract that from the total to find the fifth. \n\nAnother way to think about it: maybe the problem is designed so that the fifth house has 20 minus 4 times 3, which is 20 - 12 = 8. Yep, that's the same as before. So, regardless of the approach, the answer seems to be 8. \n\nI think that's solid. No need to overcomplicate. The answer is 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe fifth house has \\boxed{8} gnomes.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many gnomes the fifth house has, we start by analyzing the information provided:\n\n- There are **5 houses** on the street.\n- Each of the **first four houses** has **3 gnomes**.\n- The **total number of gnomes** on the street is **20**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the total number of gnomes in the first four houses\n\nSince each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes, the total number of gnomes in those houses is:\n\n$$\n4 \\times 3 = 12\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Subtract the gnomes in the first four houses from the total\n\nThe total number of gnomes on the street is 20.

{"question_id": "q_0029", "model_name": "qwen3-0.6b", "model_params": "0.6B", "question": "Mrs. Snyder used to spend 40% of her monthly income on rent and utilities. Her salary was recently increased by $600 so now her rent and utilities only amount to 25% of her monthly income. How much was her previous monthly income?", "gold_answer": "1000", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Mrs. Snyder used to spend 40% of her monthly income on rent and utilities. Now, after her salary was increased by $600, her rent and utilities only amount to 25% of her monthly income. I need to find out how much her previous monthly income was. Hmm, let me think.\n\nFirst, let me denote her previous monthly income as some variable. Let me call it P. So, before the salary increase, she spent 40% of P on rent and utilities. That means she spent 0.4P on rent and utilities. The remaining 60% of her income would be her salary. So, her salary before the increase was P - 0.4P, which is 0.6P. \n\nNow, after the salary was increased by $600, her new salary is 0.6P + 600. And now, her rent and utilities are only 25% of her new salary. So, the amount she spent on rent and utilities is 0.25*(0.6P + 600). \n\nBut wait, the problem says that the amount she spent on rent and utilities is now 25% of her monthly income. So, maybe I need to set up an equation here. Let me write that down.\n\nOriginal amount spent on rent and utilities: 0.4P\n\nNew amount spent on rent and utilities: 0.25*(0.6P + 600)\n\nBut since the problem says that the amount she spent on rent and utilities is now 25% of her monthly income, which is 0.25*(new salary). But maybe I need to check if the 25% is of her new salary or her previous salary? Wait, the problem says \"now her rent and utilities only amount to 25% of her monthly income\". So, 25% of her new salary. Therefore, the equation should be:\n\n0.25*(0.6P + 600) = 0.4P\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check again. Before the increase, she spent 40% on rent and utilities, which is 0.4P. Now, after the increase, her rent and utilities are 25% of her new salary. So, the amount she spent on rent and utilities is 0.25*(new salary). Therefore, the equation should be:\n\n0.25*(new salary) = 0.4P\n\nBut new salary is previous salary plus 600. So, new salary = 0.6P + 600. Therefore:\n\n0.25*(0.6P + 600) = 0.4P\n\nYes, that seems right. Let me solve this equation for P.\n\nFirst, expand the left side:\n\n0.25*(0.6P) + 0.25*600 = 0.4P\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n0.25*0.6P = 0.15P\n\n0.25*600 = 150\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n0.15P + 150 = 0.4P\n\nSubtract 0.15P from both sides:\n\n150 = 0.4P - 0.15P\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n150 = 0.25P\n\nTherefore, solving for P:\n\nP = 150 / 0.25\n\nCalculating that, 150 divided by 0.25 is 600. So, her previous monthly income was $600?\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal income: 600. 40% is 240. 600 - 240 = 360. Then, after increasing by 600, new salary is 600 + 600 = 1200. 25% of 1200 is 300. But she spent 240 on rent and utilities. Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, that contradicts my previous answer. So, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, hold on. If her previous monthly income was $600, then 40% is 240. So, rent and utilities are 240. Then, her salary is 600 - 240 = 360. Then, after increasing by 600, her new salary is 360 + 600 = 960. 25% of 960 is 240. Which matches the previous amount. So, that works. So, my answer was correct. But when I thought of 25% of 1200, I was wrong. Because 25% of 1200 is 300, but the rent and utilities are 240. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I think I confused the new salary. Let me check again. If her previous salary was 600, then after increasing by 600, it's 1200. But 25% of 1200 is 300, but she spent 240. So, that's inconsistent. Wait, so why did my equation give me 600? Because when I set up the equation, I think I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me go back. The equation was:\n\n0.25*(0.6P + 600) = 0.4P\n\nWhich led me to P = 600. Let me check that again.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\n0.25*(0.6P + 600) = 0.4P\n\nMultiply out:\n\n0.15P + 150 = 0.4P\n\nSubtract 0.15P:\n\n150 = 0.25P\n\nTherefore, P = 150 / 0.25 = 600. So, that's correct. But when I plug in P = 600, the rent and utilities are 240, and the new salary is 1200, which is 25% of 1200? Wait, 25% of 1200 is 300. But she spent 240. So, that's not matching. Wait, so there's a contradiction here. Which means I made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, so where is the mistake? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"Her salary was recently increased by $600 so now her rent and utilities only amount to 25% of her monthly income.\"\n\nSo, after the increase, her rent and utilities are 25% of her monthly income. So, if her previous salary was P, then after increase, it's P + 600. The rent and utilities are 25% of (P + 600). But before the increase, she spent 40% of P on rent and utilities. So, the amount she spent on rent and utilities before was 0.4P, and after the increase, it's 0.25*(P + 600). But the problem says that the amount she spent on rent and utilities is now 25% of her monthly income. So, that would mean 0.25*(P + 600) = 0.4P. Which is the same equation as before. Therefore, solving that gives P = 600. But when I plug in P = 600, the rent and utilities are 240, and the new salary is 1200. But 25% of 1200 is 300. So, why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe my understanding is wrong. Let me check again. Maybe the problem says that now her rent and utilities are 25% of her monthly income, which is the same as before? But no, the problem says \"now her rent and utilities only amount to 25% of her monthly income\". So, after the increase, the amount is 25% of her new salary. So, if her previous salary was P, then after increase, it's P + 600. The amount she spent on rent and utilities is 25% of (P + 600). But before, it was 40% of P. So, the equation is 0.25*(P + 600) = 0.4P. Which gives P = 600. But when I plug in P = 600, the rent and utilities are 240, and the new salary is 1200. But 25% of 1200 is 300. So, why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"Her salary was recently increased by $600 so now her rent and utilities only amount to 25% of her monthly income.\" So, after the increase, her rent and utilities are 25% of her monthly income. So, if her previous salary was P, then after increase, her salary is P + 600.
