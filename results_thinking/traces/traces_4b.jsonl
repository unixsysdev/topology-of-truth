Then in May, she sold half as many as in April. So I need to find the total number of clips she sold in both months.\n\nFirst, let me confirm the numbers. In April, it's 48 clips. Then in May, it's half of that. Half of 48 is... let me calculate that. 48 divided by 2 is 24. So she sold 24 clips in May.\n\nNow, to find the total, I need to add the number of clips from April and May together. That would be 48 plus 24. Let me do the addition. 48 + 24... 40 + 20 is 60, and 8 + 4 is 12. So 60 + 12 is 72. Therefore, the total number of clips sold in April and May is 72.\n\nWait, let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. April is 48, May is half of April, so 48 / 2 = 24. Then 48 + 24. Yeah, that's 72. Hmm, seems right. Maybe I can think of it another way. If she sold 48 in April and 24 in May, then combined it's like 48 + 24.

How much did she earn?", "gold_answer": "10", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, so Weng earns $12 per hour for babysitting, and she worked 50 minutes yesterday. I need to figure out how much she earned. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that her pay is based on hours, but she worked 50 minutes, which is less than an hour. So I need to convert the minutes into a fraction of an hour or maybe convert the hourly rate into a per-minute rate. Let me try both approaches and see which one works.\n\nApproach 1: Convert minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 50 minutes is 50/60 hours. Simplifying that fraction, 50 divided by 60 is the same as 5/6. So she worked 5/6 of an hour. Then, multiply that by her hourly rate of $12. So 5/6 * 12. Let me calculate that. 12 divided by 6 is 2, and 2 times 5 is 10. So that would be $10. Hmm, that seems straightforward.\n\nApproach 2: Convert the hourly rate to a per-minute rate. Since she earns $12 per hour, that's $12 per 60 minutes. So per minute, she earns 12/60 dollars. Let me compute that. 12 divided by 60 is 0.2 dollars per minute, which is 20 cents per minute. Then, multiply that by 50 minutes. 0.2 * 50 is 10. So again, $10. Okay, both methods give me the same answer. That seems consistent.\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again to be sure. For Approach 1: 50 minutes is 5/6 of an hour. 5/6 of 12. Let me do 12 * 5 = 60, then divide by 6, which is 10. Yep, that's right. For Approach 2: 12 divided by 60 is 0.2 per minute. 0.2 times 50 is 10. Correct again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of proportions. If 60 minutes = $12, then 50 minutes = x dollars. Setting up a proportion: 60/12 = 50/x. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Actually, it should be 60 minutes corresponds to $12, so 50 minutes corresponds to x dollars. So the ratio of minutes is 50/60, so x = 12 * (50/60) = 12 * 5/6 = 10. Same answer. So that's another way to think about it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe breaking down the 50 minutes into parts. For example, 30 minutes is half an hour, which would be $6. Then 20 minutes more. So 30 minutes is $6, and 20 minutes is 20/60 of an hour, which is 1/3 of an hour. So 1/3 of $12 is $4. So total would be $6 + $4 = $10. Yep, same answer again.\n\nSo all methods lead to $10. Therefore, I think the answer is $10. Let me just check once more. If she worked 50 minutes, which is 5/6 of an hour, and 5/6 of 12 is indeed 10. Yes. So I think that's correct.\n\nAnother way: Let's convert 50 minutes to hours as a decimal. 50 divided by 60 is 0.8333... hours. Then multiply by 12. 0.8333... * 12. Let me compute that. 0.8333 * 12. Well, 0.8333 is approximately 5/6, so 5/6 * 12 is 10. Alternatively, 0.8333 * 12: 0.8 * 12 = 9.6, and 0.0333 * 12 \u2248 0.4, so total \u2248 10. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the answer is $10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{10}\n</think>\n\nTo determine how much Weng earned for babysitting, we start with the information that she earns **$12 per hour** and worked **50 minutes**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Convert Minutes to Hours\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can express 50 minutes as a fraction of an hour:\n\n$$\n\\frac{50}{60} = \\frac{5}{6} \\text{ hours}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Earnings\n\nNow, multiply the fraction of the hour by her hourly rate:\n\n$$\n\\text{Earnings} = \\frac{5}{6} \\times 12 = \\frac{60}{6} = 10\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Confirm with an Alternative Method\n\nAlternatively, we can convert the hourly rate to a per-minute rate:\n\n$$\n\\frac{12}{60} = 0.2 \\text{ dollars per minute}\n$$\n\nThen multiply by the number of minutes:\n\n$$\n0.2 \\times 50 = 10\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{10}\n$$", "final_answer": "10", "num_tokens": 1218, "num_reasoning_steps": 24, "activations_path": "results_thinking/embeddings/q_0001_4b_activations.npz"}

She currently has only half of the money she needs. Hmm, so first, I need to figure out how much money Betty already has. If she needs $100 and she has half of that, then half of $100 is $50. So Betty has $50 saved up so far.\n\nNow, her parents are giving her $15 for that purpose. So adding that to her existing money, she'll have $50 + $15. Let me calculate that. 50 plus 15 is 65. So after her parents' contribution, she has $65.\n\nThen her grandparents give her twice as much as her parents. The parents gave $15, so twice that amount would be 2 times $15. Let me do the math: 2 * 15 is $30. So her grandparents give her $30.\n\nAdding that to the $65 she had from before, so $65 + $30. Let me add those numbers. 65 + 30 is 95. So after receiving money from both her parents and grandparents, Betty has $95.\n\nBut the wallet costs $100. So how much more does she need? That would be the difference between $100 and her total savings of $95. So $100 - $95 equals... $5. Therefore, Betty needs $5 more to buy the wallet.\n\nWait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with half of $100 is $50. Parents give $15, grandparents give twice that, which is $30. So total from parents and grandparents is $15 + $30 = $45. Adding to her original $50: 50 + 45 = $95. Yes, that's correct. Then $100 - $95 is indeed $5. So the answer should be $5. I think that's right. Let me just verify once more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Total needed is $100. Betty has half, which is $50. Then parents give $15, grandparents give twice parents, so $30. Total additional money is $15 + $30 = $45. So total money she has is $50 + $45 = $95.

Yes, twice 12 is 24. So, adding up the pages she's already read: 12 pages yesterday plus 24 pages today. Let me calculate that. 12 + 24 equals 36 pages. So she's read 36 pages so far.\n\nNow, the total pages are 120, so the remaining pages would be 120 minus 36. Let me do that subtraction. 120 - 36 is 84. So there are 84 pages left.

I need to figure out how many pages he writes in a year. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. James writes letters to two friends, each letter is 3 pages long, and he does this twice a week. So, I need to calculate the total number of pages he writes in a year. Alright.\n\nLet me start by figuring out how many letters he writes in a week. He writes to two friends twice a week. So, each time he writes, it's one letter per friend? Or is it two letters per week? Wait, the problem says \"to 2 different friends twice a week.\" Hmm. So maybe he writes two letters each week, one to each friend? Or does he write two letters to each friend? Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me parse it again.\n\n\"James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.\" So, the structure is: he writes a 3-page letter to 2 friends, and he does this twice a week. So, maybe each time he writes, he writes to both friends? Or does he write to each friend twice a week?\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as: for each week, he writes two letters, each to a different friend. But each letter is 3 pages. So, if he writes two letters per week, each 3 pages, then per week it's 2 * 3 = 6 pages. Then, multiply by 52 weeks in a year? But wait, maybe not. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he writes to each friend twice a week. So, two friends, each getting a letter twice a week. So, that would be 2 friends * 2 times per week = 4 letters per week. Each letter is 3 pages, so 4 * 3 = 12 pages per week. Then, 12 * 52 = ?\n\nBut which interpretation is correct? The problem says \"writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.\" The wording is a bit ambiguous. Is it that he writes two letters per week, each to a different friend? Or that he writes to each of the two friends twice a week?\n\nThe phrase \"to 2 different friends twice a week\" could be interpreted as: he writes to two friends, and he does this (writes to them) twice a week. So, maybe each time he writes, he writes to both friends. So, each week, he writes two letters (to each friend once), but twice a week? Wait, that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"twice a week\" refers to the frequency of writing. So, he writes two letters per week, each to a different friend. But each letter is 3 pages. So, 2 letters per week * 3 pages = 6 pages per week. Then, 6 * 52 = 312 pages per year.\n\nBut another way: if he writes to each friend twice a week, then that's 2 friends * 2 times per week = 4 letters per week. Each letter is 3 pages, so 4 * 3 = 12 pages per week. Then, 12 * 52 = 624 pages per year.\n\nSo, which is it? The problem is ambiguous. But maybe the original problem is structured as: he writes a 3-page letter to each of 2 friends, twice a week. So, that would be 2 friends * 3 pages = 6 pages per writing session, and he does this twice a week. So, 6 pages * 2 = 12 pages per week. Then, 12 * 52 = 624.\n\nAlternatively, if it's 3 pages per letter, and he writes to 2 friends twice a week, meaning that each week he writes two letters (to each friend once), then 2 letters * 3 pages = 6 pages per week. Then 6 * 52 = 312.\n\nBut the problem says \"writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.\" The wording is a bit unclear. However, in common language, if someone says \"I write a letter to two friends twice a week,\" it might mean that each time they write, they write to both friends. So, each writing session is two letters, each to a different friend. But if he does that twice a week, then that would be 2 letters per session * 2 sessions per week = 4 letters per week. Each letter is 3 pages, so 4 * 3 = 12 pages per week. Then, 12 * 52 = 624.\n\nAlternatively, if \"twice a week\" refers to the number of times he writes to each friend. So, he writes to each friend twice a week. Then, 2 friends * 2 times per week = 4 letters per week. Again, 4 * 3 = 12 pages per week. So same result.\n\nBut maybe the problem is intended to be simpler. Let me check the exact wording again: \"James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.\" So, the structure is: he writes a 3-page letter (singular) to 2 different friends (plural) twice a week. So, maybe each time he writes, he writes one letter to both friends? But that would be a single letter to two friends? That doesn't make sense. A letter is addressed to one person. So, he writes two letters per week, each to a different friend. Each letter is 3 pages. So, 2 letters per week * 3 pages = 6 pages per week. Then, 6 * 52 = 312.\n\nBut then, the wording is \"to 2 different friends twice a week.\" So, maybe \"twice a week\" is the frequency of writing to both friends. So, he writes to both friends twice a week. So, each time he writes, he writes to both friends. So, each writing session is two letters. So, twice a week, he writes two letters (to each friend once). Therefore, 2 letters per week * 3 pages = 6 pages per week. Then, 6 * 52 = 312.\n\nBut if he writes to each friend twice a week, that would be 2 friends * 2 times per week = 4 letters per week. Each letter is 3 pages, so 12 pages per week. Then, 12 * 52 = 624.\n\nSo, which is correct? The problem is ambiguous. However, in standard interpretation, if you say \"writes a letter to two friends twice a week,\" it might mean that he writes two letters per week, each to a different friend. So, each week, he writes two letters, each 3 pages. Therefore, 2 * 3 = 6 pages per week. Then, 6 * 52 = 312.\n\nBut maybe the problem is intended to be that he writes two letters per week, each to a different friend, each letter being 3 pages. So, that would be 2 * 3 = 6 pages per week. But if he writes to each friend twice a week, that would be 2 friends * 2 times per week = 4 letters, 4 * 3 = 12 pages per week.\n\nBut the problem says \"to 2 different friends twice a week.\" The phrase \"twice a week\" is modifying the action of writing to the friends. So, he writes to the two friends twice a week. So, each time he writes, he writes to both friends. So, each writing session is two letters. Therefore, twice a week, he writes two letters (to each friend once). Therefore, 2 letters per week * 3 pages = 6 pages per week. Then, 6 * 52 = 312.\n\nAlternatively, if \"twice a week\" is the number of times he writes to each friend, then it's 2 friends * 2 times per week = 4 letters per week. But the wording is \"to 2 different friends twice a week,\" which could be interpreted as writing to both friends twice a week. So, each time he writes, he writes to both friends. So, two letters per week. Therefore, 6 pages per week.\n\nBut maybe the problem is intended to be that he writes two letters per week, each to a different friend. So, two letters per week, each 3 pages. So, 6 pages per week. Then, 6 * 52 = 312.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that he writes to each friend twice a week, so two letters per friend per week. So, 2 friends * 2 letters = 4 letters per week. Each letter is 3 pages. So, 4 * 3 = 12 pages per week. Then, 12 * 52 = 624.\n\nBut how to figure out which is correct? Maybe looking at the wording again. The problem says \"writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.\" The key is the phrase \"to 2 different friends twice a week.\" So, the \"twice a week\" is modifying the action of writing to the friends.

How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?", "gold_answer": "35", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Mark has a garden with flowers of three different colors: yellow, purple, and green. The problem gives me some information about the number of each color. I need to find the total number of flowers in the garden. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, it says there are 10 yellow flowers. So, yellow = 10. Got that.\n\nThen, it mentions there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow. Hmm, 80% more than yellow. Wait, so if yellow is 10, then 80% of 10 is 8. So, does that mean purple is 10 + 8 = 18? Let me make sure. If something is 80% more than another, you take the original amount, add 80% of that to it. So yes, 10 + 0.8*10 = 18. So purple is 18. Let me note that down: purple = 18.\n\nNext, there are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. Hmm. So green is 25% of (yellow + purple). Let me compute that. First, yellow + purple is 10 + 18 = 28. Then 25% of 28 is 0.25*28. Let me calculate that. 28 divided by 4 is 7. So green is 7. So green = 7.\n\nTherefore, total flowers would be yellow + purple + green = 10 + 18 + 7. Let me add those up. 10 + 18 is 28, plus 7 is 35. So total flowers are 35? Wait, that seems low, but let me check again.\n\nWait, let me verify each step again. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the percentages.\n\nStarting with yellow: 10. Purple is 80% more than yellow. So 80% of yellow is 0.8*10 = 8. So purple is 10 + 8 = 18. That seems right.\n\nThen green is 25% as many as yellow and purple. So yellow and purple together are 10 + 18 = 28. 25% of 28 is 7. So green is 7. Then total is 10 + 18 + 7 = 35. Hmm. Maybe that's correct? Let me check if there's another way to interpret the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says \"there are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers.\" So that would mean green = 25% * (yellow + purple). Which is exactly what I did. So 25% of 28 is 7. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is saying that green is 25% of the total number of yellow and purple? Which is the same thing. So that's 7. So total is 35. Hmm. Maybe that's correct. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read again:\n\n\"Ten of them are yellow, and there are 80% more of those in purple. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?\"\n\nSo, yes, yellow is 10. Purple is 80% more than yellow. So 10 + 80% of 10 = 18. Then green is 25% of (yellow + purple). So 25% of 28 is 7. So total is 10 + 18 + 7 = 35. So 35 is the answer? But maybe I need to check if there's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, sometimes \"80% more\" can be confusing. Let me think. If something is 80% more than another, does that mean multiplying by 1.8? For example, if you have 10, 80% more would be 10 * 1.8 = 18. Which is what I did. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that 80% more is adding 80% of the original, which is the same thing. So 10 + 8 = 18. So that's correct.\n\nThen green is 25% as many as yellow and purple. So 25% of the sum of yellow and purple. Which is 25% of 28. Which is 7. So that's correct.\n\nSo total is 35. Hmm. Maybe that's the answer. But let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nYellow: 10. Purple: 18. Green: 7. 10 + 18 is 28. 28 + 7 is 35. Yes. So 35. Maybe that's correct. But let me think again if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers.\" So maybe green is 25% of yellow and 25% of purple? But that would be different. But the wording is \"as there are yellow and purple flowers.\" So that would mean green is 25% of the total of yellow and purple. So that's 25% of (yellow + purple). So that's 7. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if it was 25% as many green as yellow and 25% as many green as purple, but that would be different. But the wording is \"as there are yellow and purple flowers,\" so it's 25% of the total of yellow and purple. So that's 7. So I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the translation. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers.\"\n\nSo \"as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers\" would mean green = 25% * (yellow + purple). So that's 7. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if it was \"25% as many green flowers as yellow and purple flowers,\" meaning green is 25% of yellow and 25% of purple? But that would be different. But that would be strange wording. The correct interpretation is that green is 25% of the total of yellow and purple. So 7.\n\nTherefore, total is 35. So I think that is the answer. Maybe 35 is correct. Let me check once more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says \"there are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers.\" So \"only 25% as many\" meaning that green is 25% of the total of yellow and purple. So yes, that's 7. So total is 35. So I think that is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if there's a different way to compute 80% more. Let me think. If you have 10 yellow, and 80% more purple. So if you have 10, then 80% more would be 10 * 1.8 = 18. So that's correct. So purple is 18. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that 80% more is 80% of the total, but that would be wrong. But no, the standard interpretation is that if something is 80% more than another, you take the original and add 80% of it. So 10 + 80% of 10 = 18. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 35. So total flowers is 35. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{35}.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Maybe I miscalculated 25% of 28. 28 divided by 4 is 7. Yes. 25% is 1/4. 28 divided by 4 is 7. So that's correct. So 10 + 18 + 7 is 35. So yes. I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the translation of \"there are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers.\" Maybe \"only 25% as many\" is meant to imply that green is 25% of the total number of flowers? But that would be different. Wait, but the wording is \"as there are yellow and purple flowers.\" So it's 25% of the number of yellow and purple flowers. So that would be 25% of (yellow + purple). So that's 7. If it was 25% of the total flowers, then it would be different. But the wording is \"as there are yellow and purple flowers,\" so it's 25% of yellow and purple. So that's 7. So I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the translation. Maybe \"there are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers.\" So \"as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers\" would be green = yellow + purple.

A large pizza has 16 slices and a small pizza has 8 slices. If he eats it all, how many pieces does he eat that day?", "gold_answer": "48", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how many pizza slices Albert eats in one day. So, he buys 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas. Each large pizza has 16 slices, and each small one has 8 slices. If he eats all of them, how many slices is that in total?\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the number of slices from the large pizzas. Since there are 2 large pizzas and each has 16 slices, I should multiply 2 by 16. Let me do that: 2 times 16 is 32. So, the large pizzas contribute 32 slices.\n\nNext, I need to figure out the slices from the small pizzas. There are 2 small pizzas, each with 8 slices. So, multiplying 2 by 8 gives me 16. Therefore, the small pizzas add 16 slices.\n\nNow, to find the total number of slices Albert eats, I should add the slices from the large and small pizzas together. That would be 32 (from large) plus 16 (from small). Adding those together: 32 + 16 equals 48. \n\nWait, let me check that again. 2 large pizzas at 16 slices each: 2*16=32. 2 small pizzas at 8 slices each: 2*8=16. Then 32+16=48. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nHmm, is there any chance I misread the problem? Let me check again. He buys 2 large and 2 small. Large is 16 slices, small is 8. He eats all of them. So yes, total slices would be (2*16)+(2*8)=32+16=48. \n\nI think that's correct. Maybe I can break it down another way. For example, each large pizza is 16, so two of them are 16+16=32. Each small is 8, so two of them are 8+8=16. Then 32+16=48. Yep, same answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe think in terms of total pizzas. But no, the question is about slices. So, no, that's not necessary. \n\nI don't see any mistakes here. So the answer should be 48 slices.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many pizza slices Albert eats in one day, we need to calculate the total number of slices from both the large and small pizzas he buys.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Calculate slices from large pizzas\n\nAlbert buys **2 large pizzas**, and each large pizza has **16 slices**.\n\n$$\n2 \\text{ large pizzas} \\times 16 \\text{ slices per pizza} = 32 \\text{ slices}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate slices from small pizzas\n\nAlbert also buys **2 small pizzas**, and each small pizza has **8 slices**.\n\n$$\n2 \\text{ small pizzas} \\times 8 \\text{ slices per pizza} = 16 \\text{ slices}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Add the slices from both types of pizzas\n\n$$\n32 \\text{ (from large pizzas)} + 16 \\text{ (from small pizzas)} = 48 \\text{ slices}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{48}\n$$", "final_answer": "48", "num_tokens": 727, "num_reasoning_steps": 19, "activations_path": "results_thinking/embeddings/q_0006_4b_activations.npz"}

Ken placed a box on a scale, and then he poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.  Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple.  Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans.  And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again.  What was the final weight of the box of goodies, in pounds?", "gold_answer": "16", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the final weight of the care package. So, Ken starts with a box on a scale. First, he adds jelly beans until the weight is 2 pounds. Then he adds brownies, which triples the weight. Then he adds another 2 pounds of jelly beans, and finally adds gummy worms that double the weight again. I need to find the final weight.\n\nLet me break it down step by step. Let me start with the first step. The box initially is empty, right? Then he adds jelly beans to make it 2 pounds. So, after adding jelly beans, the weight is 2 pounds. Let me note that down:\n\n1. After jelly beans: 2 pounds.\n\nThen he adds brownies, which causes the weight to triple. Tripling the current weight. So tripling 2 pounds would be 2 * 3 = 6 pounds. So after adding brownies, the weight is 6 pounds. Let me write that:\n\n2. After adding brownies: 6 pounds.\n\nNext, he adds another 2 pounds of jelly beans. So, adding 2 pounds to the current weight. So 6 + 2 = 8 pounds. So now the weight is 8 pounds. Let me check that again. The previous weight was 6 pounds, adding 2 pounds of jelly beans, so yes, 6 + 2 = 8. So:\n\n3. After adding another 2 pounds of jelly beans: 8 pounds.\n\nThen, finally, he adds gummy worms to double the weight. So doubling the current weight. The current weight is 8 pounds, so doubling that would be 8 * 2 = 16 pounds. Therefore, the final weight is 16 pounds. Let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the box. First, jelly beans make it 2 pounds. Then brownies triple it: 2 * 3 = 6. Then adding 2 pounds of jelly beans: 6 + 2 = 8. Then gummy worms double it: 8 * 2 = 16. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When they say \"enough brownies to cause the weight to triple,\" does that mean the total weight triples? So if the initial weight was 2 pounds, then tripling would be 6 pounds. Yes, that's what I did. Then adding 2 pounds of jelly beans, so 6 + 2 = 8. Then doubling that with gummy worms: 8 * 2 = 16. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nIs there any chance that I misread the problem? Let me check again.\n\n\"Ken placed a box on a scale, and then he poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds. Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple. Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans. And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again.\"\n\nSo, step by step:\n\nStart with box. Add jelly beans to get 2 pounds. Then add brownies, tripling the weight. Then add 2 pounds of jelly beans. Then add gummy worms, doubling the weight.\n\nYes, so the steps are:\n\nStart: 0 pounds (assuming the box itself is negligible? Or is the box's weight considered? Wait, the problem says \"the weight to 2 pounds\"\u2014so the box plus the jelly beans is 2 pounds. Then adding brownies triples the weight. So the box itself is part of the weight. But since the problem is about the total weight, I think we can just track the total weight through each step.\n\nSo, initial weight after jelly beans: 2 pounds. Then adding brownies triples the weight. So 2 * 3 = 6. Then adding 2 pounds of jelly beans: 6 + 2 = 8. Then adding gummy worms doubles the weight: 8 * 2 = 16. So the final weight is 16 pounds. That seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to think about the box's weight? But the problem says \"the weight to 2 pounds\"\u2014so that includes the box? Wait, but when he adds brownies, does the box's weight get included in the tripling? I think so. Because the scale is measuring the total weight of the box plus the contents. So when he adds brownies, the total weight triples. So the box is part of the weight. But since the problem is only asking for the final weight, and all the operations are done on the total weight, I think my previous calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the box itself is considered as part of the weight? But the problem says \"Ken placed a box on a scale\"\u2014so the box is on the scale. Then he adds jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds. So the box plus jelly beans is 2 pounds. Then he adds brownies, which causes the weight to triple. So the total weight becomes 3 times the previous total. So 2 * 3 = 6. Then he adds another 2 pounds of jelly beans, so 6 + 2 = 8. Then adds gummy worms to double the weight, so 8 * 2 = 16. So yes, 16 pounds.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check if there's another way to interpret the problem. For example, maybe \"triple the weight\" refers to tripling the weight of the brownies? But that would be a different interpretation. But the problem says \"cause the weight to triple\"\u2014so that would mean the total weight triples. So if the total weight was 2 pounds, then tripling it would be 6 pounds. So that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if \"triple the weight\" meant that the brownies added triple the previous weight. But that would be different. For example, if the previous weight was 2 pounds, then adding brownies that triple the weight would mean adding 2 * 3 = 6 pounds of brownies? But that would make the total weight 2 + 6 = 8 pounds. But the problem says \"cause the weight to triple\"\u2014so that would mean the total weight triples. So the total weight becomes 3 times the original. So that would be 2 * 3 = 6. So that seems more logical.\n\nSo, I think my original calculation is correct. Therefore, the final weight is 16 pounds.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe final weight of the box of goodies is \\boxed{16} pounds.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the final weight of the care package, we'll analyze the sequence of events step by step, tracking the weight changes as described.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Adding Jelly Beans\nKen starts with an empty box and adds jelly beans until the total weight is **2 pounds**.\n\n- **Weight after jelly beans:**  \n  $$\n  2 \\text{ pounds}\n  $$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Adding Brownies\nHe then adds brownies, which **triples** the current weight.\n\n- **Weight after adding brownies:**  \n  $$\n  2 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ pounds}\n  $$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Adding More Jelly Beans\nNext, he adds **another 2 pounds** of jelly beans.\n\n- **Weight after adding 2 pounds of jelly beans:**  \n  $$\n  6 + 2 = 8 \\text{ pounds}\n  $$\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Adding Gummy Worms\nFinally, he adds gummy worms that **double** the current weight.\n\n- **Final weight after adding gummy worms:**  \n  $$\n  8 \\times 2 = 16 \\text{ pounds}\n  $$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final weight of the box of goodies is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{16}\n$$", "final_answer": "16", "num_tokens": 1675, "num_reasoning_steps": 43, "activations_path": "results_thinking/embeddings/q_0007_4b_activations.npz"}

She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?", "gold_answer": "41", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Alexis had a budget of $200 for her new business clothes. She bought several items and spent some money on them, but she lost the receipt for the shoes. Now she has $16 left from her budget. I need to figure out how much she paid for the shoes. \n\nFirst, I should probably start by adding up all the amounts she spent on the items she bought with the receipts. Then, since she has $16 left, I can subtract that from her original budget to find out how much she spent in total. Then, subtract the known expenses from that total to find the cost of the shoes. Let me write that down step by step.\n\nOriginal budget: $200.\n\nAmounts spent on items with receipts:\n- Button-up shirt: $30\n- Suit pants: $46\n- Suit coat: $38\n- Socks: $11\n- Belt: $18\n- Shoes: ? (This is what we need to find)\n\nShe has $16 left. So total amount spent is original budget minus the remaining money. That would be $200 - $16 = $184. So she spent $184 in total.\n\nNow, let's add up the known expenses. Let me calculate that:\n\nStarting with the shirt: $30.\n\nAdding the suit pants: $30 + $46. Let me do that. 30 + 46 is 76.\n\nThen adding the suit coat: $76 + $38. Hmm, 76 + 38. Let me compute that. 70 + 30 is 100, 6 + 8 is 14, so total is 114? Wait, no. Wait, 76 + 38. Let me do it properly. 76 + 30 is 106, then +8 is 114. Yes, that's right.\n\nNext, socks: $11. So adding that to the previous total: 114 + 11 = 125.\n\nThen the belt: $18. Adding that to 125: 125 + 18. Let me calculate that. 125 + 10 is 135, plus 8 is 143. So total so far is $143.\n\nSo the total spent on those items is $143. Then, the shoes must be the remaining amount. Since total spent is $184, then the shoes cost $184 - $143. Let me compute that.\n\n184 minus 143. Let's see, 184 - 140 is 44, then minus 3 more is 41. So the shoes cost $41?\n\nWait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in adding up the known expenses. Let me verify each step again.\n\nStarting with the shirt: $30.\n\nSuit pants: $46. 30 + 46 = 76. Correct.\n\nSuit coat: $38. 76 + 38. Let me do 76 + 38. 70 + 30 is 100, 6 + 8 is 14. So 100 + 14 is 114. Correct.\n\nSocks: $11. 114 + 11 = 125. Correct.\n\nBelt: $18. 125 + 18. 125 + 10 is 135, plus 8 is 143. Correct.\n\nTotal known expenses: $143. Total spent overall: $184. So shoes are 184 - 143. Let me do that subtraction again. 184 - 143. \n\nAlternatively, 143 + 41 = 184? Let's check: 143 + 40 is 183, plus 1 is 184. Yes, so 41. So the shoes cost $41. \n\nBut let me check another way. Maybe adding all the known expenses and the shoes should equal $184. So 143 + shoes = 184. Therefore, shoes = 184 - 143 = 41. Yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the total budget. Original budget is $200. She spent $184, and has $16 left. So 184 + 16 = 200. Correct. So that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can add up all the items again. Let me try that.\n\nShirt: 30\n\nPants: 46. 30 + 46 = 76.\n\nCoat: 38. 76 + 38 = 114.\n\nSocks: 11. 114 + 11 = 125.\n\nBelt: 18. 125 + 18 = 143.\n\nShoes: let's call it x. So total is 143 + x. And that equals 184. So x is 41. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if 30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18 + x = 200 - 16. Which is 184. So same thing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can add all the numbers again. Let me try adding them in a different order. Maybe 30 + 46 is 76. 38 + 11 is 49. 18 is 18. Then 76 + 49 is 125. 125 + 18 is 143. Then same as before. So shoes are 41. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if 41 is a reasonable number. Let me think. The total budget is 200. She spent 30 on shirt, 46 on pants, 38 on coat, 11 on socks, 18 on belt, and 41 on shoes. Let me add them all again:\n\n30 + 46 = 76\n\n76 + 38 = 114\n\n114 + 11 = 125\n\n125 + 18 = 143\n\n143 + 41 = 184. \n\nYes, that's correct. And 184 + 16 = 200. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is $41. So Alexis paid $41 for the shoes.\n\n**Final Answer**\nAlexis paid \\boxed{41} dollars for the shoes.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how much Alexis paid for the shoes, we begin by analyzing the total amount she spent and the remaining money from her budget.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Total Budget and Remaining Money\n\nAlexis had a total budget of **$200**. After her purchases, she has **$16** left. This means she spent:\n\n$$\n200 - 16 = 184 \\text{ dollars}\n$$\n\nSo, the total amount she spent on all items is **$184**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Sum of Known Expenses\n\nWe are given the prices of the following items:\n\n- Button-up shirt: $30  \n- Suit pants: $46  \n- Suit coat: $38  \n- Socks: $11  \n- Belt: $18  \n\nLet\u2019s add these up:\n\n$$\n30 + 46 = 76  \n76 + 38 = 114  \n114 + 11 = 125  \n125 + 18 = 143\n$$\n\nSo, the total spent on these items is **$143**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Cost of the Shoes\n\nWe now know that the total spent on all items is **$184**, and the sum of the known items is **$143**. Therefore, the cost of the shoes is:\n\n$$\n184 - 143 = 41\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{41}\n$$", "final_answer": "41", "num_tokens": 1840, "num_reasoning_steps": 69, "activations_path": "results_thinking/embeddings/q_0008_4b_activations.npz"}

If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.  If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?", "gold_answer": "990", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how much Tina makes. So, first, Tina earns $18.00 per hour. Now, if she works more than 8 hours in a shift, she gets overtime. The overtime pay is her regular hourly wage plus half of her hourly wage. Hmm, let me make sure I understand that correctly. So, if her regular rate is $18, then overtime would be $18 plus half of $18? Let me calculate that. Half of 18 is 9, so overtime rate would be 18 + 9 = $27 per hour? Wait, is that right? The problem says \"your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.\" So yeah, that would be 18 + (1/2)*18, which is 27. Okay, so overtime is $27 per hour.\n\nNow, the question says she works 10 hours every day for 5 days. So, first, I need to figure out how much she makes per day and then multiply by 5 days. But since she works 10 hours each day, which is more than 8 hours, she should get overtime for those hours. Wait, but how is the overtime calculated? Is it that for each hour over 8, she gets overtime? Or is the entire shift considered for overtime?\n\nLet me think. Typically, overtime is paid for hours worked beyond the regular hours. So if she works 10 hours, that's 8 regular hours and 2 overtime hours. So, for each of those 2 hours, she gets the overtime rate. So, per day, she would earn 8 hours at $18 and 2 hours at $27. Then multiply that by 5 days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that if she works more than 8 hours per shift, then the entire shift is paid at overtime rate? But that seems unlikely. Usually, overtime is only for the hours beyond the regular hours. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.\" Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Is the entire shift paid at the overtime rate, or only the hours beyond 8?\n\nBut in most cases, overtime is only for the hours beyond the regular hours. So, for example, if you work 10 hours, you get 8 hours at regular rate and 2 hours at overtime rate. However, the problem says \"if she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.\" The wording here is a bit unclear. Maybe it's saying that her overtime rate is her regular wage plus half her wage, so that's 27 per hour. But does that mean that all hours over 8 are paid at 27? Or is the entire shift paid at 27?\n\nBut if she works 10 hours, then maybe the first 8 hours are regular, and the remaining 2 hours are overtime. So, let me go with that interpretation because that's standard. So, per day, she works 10 hours. So, 8 hours at $18 and 2 hours at $27. Then, total per day would be 8*18 + 2*27. Then multiply by 5 days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is saying that if she works more than 8 hours, then her entire shift is paid at the overtime rate. But that would be different. Let me check the exact wording again: \"If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.\" So, maybe \"which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage\" refers to the overtime rate. So, the overtime rate is 18 + 1/2*18 = 27. So, if she works more than 8 hours, then the overtime hours are paid at 27. But how many hours are considered overtime?\n\nIn most cases, the first 8 hours are regular, and any hours beyond that are overtime. So, if she works 10 hours, then 8 regular and 2 overtime. Therefore, total pay would be 8*18 + 2*27. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 8*18. 8*10 is 80, 8*8 is 64, so 80+64=144? Wait, no. Wait, 18*8. Let me do 10*8=80, 8*8=64, so 80+64=144? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 18*8 is 144? Wait, 10*8=80, 8*8=64, so 80+64=144? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 18*8 is 144? Let me check with another way. 18*2=36, so 18*8=36*4=144. Yes, that's correct. So 8 hours at $18 is $144.\n\nThen, 2 hours at $27. 2*27 is 54. So, per day, she makes 144 + 54 = $198. Then, for 5 days, that would be 198*5. Let me calculate that. 200*5 is 1000, minus 2*5=10, so 1000-10=990. So, $990?\n\nBut let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the entire shift is paid at the overtime rate. If that's the case, then for 10 hours, she would get 10*27 = $270 per day. Then, 270*5=1350. But that seems like a lot more. Which interpretation is correct?\n\nThe problem says \"if she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.\" The wording is a bit ambiguous. However, in most standard overtime calculations, only the hours beyond 8 are paid at the overtime rate. So, I think the first interpretation is correct. However, maybe the problem is saying that if she works more than 8 hours, then her entire shift is paid at the overtime rate. Let me check the exact wording again.\n\nThe problem says: \"If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.\" So, maybe \"which is paid by...\" refers to the overtime pay. So, the overtime pay is calculated as her hourly wage plus half her hourly wage. So, that would be 18 + 9 = 27. So, if she works more than 8 hours, then her overtime pay is 27 per hour. But how many hours are considered overtime?\n\nThe problem doesn't specify whether the entire shift is paid at the overtime rate or only the hours beyond 8. However, given that it's a math problem, it's likely that they expect the standard calculation where only the hours over 8 are paid at the overtime rate. Therefore, 10 hours per day would be 8 hours at $18 and 2 hours at $27.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the entire shift is paid at the overtime rate. But that would be unusual. Let me check if there's another way. Maybe the problem is saying that if she works more than 8 hours, then her total pay is calculated as her hourly wage plus half her hourly wage for the entire shift. But that would be strange. For example, if she works 10 hours, then her total pay would be 10*(18 + 9) = 10*27 = 270. But that would be equivalent to 10 hours at 27, which is different from the standard overtime calculation.\n\nBut maybe the problem is phrased in a way that if she works more than 8 hours, then her entire shift is paid at the overtime rate. However, that's not standard. But since the problem says \"eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage,\" maybe that means that the entire shift is paid at that rate. But that seems odd. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is saying that her overtime rate is her regular wage plus half her wage, so 27, and if she works more than 8 hours, then she gets paid at that rate for the entire shift. But that would be a different calculation. However, in reality, overtime is only for hours beyond the regular hours. But since this is a math problem, maybe they just want us to calculate the total hours at the overtime rate. Wait, but the problem says \"if she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.\" So, maybe \"which is paid by...\" refers to the overtime pay.

Over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people. Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?", "gold_answer": "121", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, there's a deep-sea monster that comes up every hundred years to eat a ship. Over three hundred years, it has eaten 847 people. And each new ship has twice as many people as the last one. We need to find out how many people were on the ship in the first hundred years.\n\nFirst, let me parse the information. The monster comes once every hundred years. So in three hundred years, that would be three times, right? So three ships have been eaten by the monster. But wait, the problem says \"over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people.\" So, three ships, each with some number of people, adding up to 847. And each subsequent ship has twice as many people as the previous one. So, the first ship has, let's say, x people. Then the second ship would have 2x people, and the third ship would have 4x people. Because each new ship is twice as many as the last. So, total people would be x + 2x + 4x = 7x. And that equals 847. So, 7x = 847. Then x would be 847 divided by 7. Let me check that.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm not missing something. The problem says \"ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship.\" So, the first ship is the first one, then the second ship is twice as big as the first, the third is twice as big as the second, so that would be 2x, 4x, etc. So, over three hundred years, three ships. So total people is x + 2x + 4x = 7x = 847. Therefore, x is 847 divided by 7. Let me compute that.\n\nDividing 847 by 7. 7 times 120 is 840. So 847 minus 840 is 7. So that's 120 + 1 = 121. So x is 121. Therefore, the first ship had 121 people. Is that the answer? Wait, but let me check again. Maybe I need to think about the timeline.\n\nWait, the monster rises once every hundred years. So, the first occurrence is at year 100, then year 200, then year 300. So over three hundred years, three ships. So the first ship is at 100 years, second at 200, third at 300. Each subsequent ship is twice as big as the previous. So first ship: x, second: 2x, third: 4x. Total is x + 2x + 4x = 7x = 847. Therefore, x = 121. So the answer is 121. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut let me check if there's another interpretation. Maybe the problem is that the ships are built larger over time, so each new ship is twice as many as the last. But maybe the first ship is the first one, then the second ship is twice as big as the first, then the third is twice as big as the second. So that would be the same as before. So, yeah, 121. But let me check if 7 times 121 is indeed 847.\n\nCalculating 7*121: 7*120 is 840, plus 7*1 is 7, so 847. Yes, that's correct. So that seems to check out.\n\nBut wait, maybe the problem is that the monster comes once every hundred years, but over three hundred years, how many times has it come? Well, 300 divided by 100 is 3. So three times. So three ships. So that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the first ship is in the first hundred years, then the second ship is in the next hundred years, and the third ship is in the third hundred years. So, each ship is in a hundred-year period. So, the first ship is the first hundred years, second is the second hundred, third is the third hundred. So, each subsequent ship is twice as big as the previous. So, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the ships are built larger over time, so each new ship is twice as many as the last. So, if the first ship is x, then the second is 2x, third is 4x. So total is 7x. So 7x=847, x=121. So that seems to be the answer.\n\nBut maybe there's a trick here. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is that the first ship is in the first hundred years, then the second ship is in the second hundred years, but maybe the third ship is in the third hundred years. But the problem says \"over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people.\" So, three ships. So, the total is 847. So, the answer is 121. But maybe I need to check if the problem is in another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the first ship is in the first hundred years, then the second ship is in the next hundred years, but the third ship is in the third hundred years. But the problem says \"each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship.\" So, the first ship is x, second is 2x, third is 4x. So total is x + 2x + 4x = 7x = 847. So x is 121. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the first ship is the first one, then the second ship is twice as big as the first, but the third ship is twice as big as the second, so that would be x, 2x, 4x. So same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the first ship is in the first hundred years, then the second ship is in the second hundred years, but the third ship is in the third hundred years. But the problem says \"ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship.\" So, each new ship is twice as many as the last. So, the first ship is x, second is 2x, third is 4x. So total is 7x. So 7x=847. So x=121. Therefore, the answer is 121.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the first ship is in the first hundred years, then the second ship is in the second hundred years, but the third ship is in the third hundred years. But maybe the problem is that the monster comes once every hundred years, so in three hundred years, it comes three times. So, three ships. So, the answer is 121. So, I think that is correct.\n\nBut let me check again. Maybe the problem is that the first ship is in the first hundred years, then the second ship is in the second hundred years, which is twice as big as the first. Then the third ship is in the third hundred years, which is twice as big as the second. So, first ship: x, second: 2x, third: 4x. Total: x + 2x + 4x = 7x = 847. Therefore, x = 121. So, the answer is 121. Therefore, I think that is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the first ship is in the first hundred years, then the second ship is in the next hundred years, but the third ship is in the third hundred years. But maybe the problem is that the ships are built larger over time, so each new ship is twice as many as the last. So, the first ship is x, second is 2x, third is 4x. So, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the first ship is in the first hundred years, then the second ship is in the second hundred years, which is twice as big as the first. Then the third ship is in the third hundred years, which is twice as big as the second.

Then the third ship is in the third hundred years, which is twice as big as the second. So, same as before.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 121. Therefore, the number of people on the first ship is 121. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{121}.\n\nBut let me check again. Maybe there's a different way to model this. Suppose that the first ship is in the first hundred years, then the second ship is in the second hundred years, which is twice as big as the first. Then the third ship is in the third hundred years, which is twice as big as the second. Therefore, the total number of people is x + 2x + 4x = 7x = 847. Therefore, x = 847 / 7 = 121.

He has been saving up his money each month for the past three months. He gets a $5 allowance a month. He also mows lawns and shovels driveways. He charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel. After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change. If he mows 4 lawns, how many driveways did he shovel?", "gold_answer": "5", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Tobias wants to buy shoes that cost $95. He's been saving money for three months. Each month, he gets a $5 allowance. Plus, he mows lawns and shovels driveways. He charges $15 per lawn and $7 per driveway. After buying the shoes, he has $15 left. The question is, if he mowed 4 lawns, how many driveways did he shovel?\n\nAlright, let me break this down. First, I need to figure out how much money Tobias has saved in total before buying the shoes. Then, subtract the cost of the shoes to find out how much he had after buying them, which is $15. But wait, actually, the problem says after buying the shoes, he has $15 in change. So that means his total savings minus the cost of the shoes equals $15. So, total savings = cost of shoes + $15. Let me write that down.\n\nTotal savings = $95 + $15 = $110. So, Tobias saved a total of $110 over three months. Now, let's figure out how much he earned from his allowance and his chores.\n\nHe gets $5 a month for three months. So, 3 months times $5 is $15. So, that's $15 from allowance. Then, he also mows lawns and shovels driveways. Let me denote the number of driveways he shoveled as D. He mowed 4 lawns, so that's 4 times $15. Let me calculate that: 4 * 15 = $60. Then, the driveways would be D * $7. So, total earnings from chores would be $60 + 7D.\n\nSo, total savings is allowance plus earnings from chores. So:\n\nTotal savings = allowance + lawn earnings + driveway earnings.\n\nWhich is:\n\n$15 (allowance) + $60 (lawn) + $7D (driveways) = $110.\n\nSo, let me write that equation:\n\n15 + 60 + 7D = 110.\n\nCombine the constants: 15 + 60 is 75. So:\n\n75 + 7D = 110.\n\nNow, subtract 75 from both sides:\n\n7D = 110 - 75.\n\n110 - 75 is 35. So:\n\n7D = 35.\n\nDivide both sides by 7:\n\nD = 35 / 7 = 5.\n\nSo, he shoveled 5 driveways. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nTotal savings: allowance is 3*5=15. Lawns: 4*15=60. Driveways: 5*7=35. Total is 15+60+35=110. Then, subtract the cost of shoes, 95, so 110-95=15. Which matches the given information. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't misread anything. The problem says he has been saving up his money each month for the past three months. So, does that mean that his total savings is the sum of allowance and chores? Yes, because he's saving up all his earnings. So, the total he had before buying the shoes is indeed 15 (allowance) + 60 (lawns) + 35 (driveways) = 110. Then, after buying shoes for 95, he has 15 left. Yep, that checks out.\n\nSo, the answer is 5 driveways. Therefore, the number of driveways he shoveled is 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{5}\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many driveways Tobias shoveled, we begin by analyzing the total amount of money he saved over the three months before purchasing the shoes.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Total Savings\n\nTobias spent $95 on shoes and had $15 left after the purchase.

How many trees does Randy have in all on his farm?", "gold_answer": "85", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Randy has 60 mango trees. Then he has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees. I need to find the total number of trees he has. Alright, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the mango trees are straightforward: 60. Now, the coconut trees are a bit more complex. The problem says he has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees. So, I need to figure out how many coconut trees that is.\n\nLet me parse that sentence again. \"5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees.\" So, \"half as many coconut trees as mango trees\" would be half of the number of mango trees. Then, subtract 5 from that number. So, mathematically, that would be (1/2)*mango trees - 5.\n\nSince there are 60 mango trees, half of that is 60 divided by 2, which is 30. Then subtract 5, so 30 - 5 equals 25. Therefore, Randy has 25 coconut trees.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If it's 5 less than half as many, then yes, half of 60 is 30, minus 5 is 25. That seems right.\n\nSo, total trees would be mango trees plus coconut trees. That's 60 + 25. Let me add that up. 60 + 25 is 85. So, Randy has 85 trees in total on his farm.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. The phrase \"5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees\" could be confusing. Let me rephrase it. If I let C be the number of coconut trees, then the problem says C = (1/2)*M - 5, where M is the number of mango trees. Since M is 60, then C = 30 - 5 = 25. Yep, that's the same as before. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might misinterpret \"5 less than half as many\" as half of (M - 5), but that would be different. Let me check that. If someone thought it was half of (M - 5), then it would be (60 - 5)/2 = 55/2 = 27.5, which is not possible because you can't have half a tree. So that interpretation is wrong. Therefore, the correct interpretation must be half of M minus 5, which is 30 - 5 = 25. So that's 25 coconut trees.\n\nTherefore, total trees are 60 + 25 = 85. So I think that's the answer. Let me just check once more.\n\nOriginal problem: \"5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees.\" So, \"half as many coconut trees as mango trees\" is half of mango trees. Then, 5 less than that. So yes, half of 60 is 30, minus 5 is 25. So 25 coconut trees. Total trees 60 + 25 = 85. That seems correct.\n\nI don't see any mistakes here. So the answer should be 85.\n\n**Final Answer**\nRandy has a total of \\boxed{85} trees on his farm.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the total number of trees on Randy's farm, we need to analyze the information given and perform the necessary calculations step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Number of Mango Trees\n\nWe are told that Randy has **60 mango trees**.\n\n$$\n\\text{Mango trees} = 60\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Number of Coconut Trees\n\nThe problem states that Randy has **5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees**.\n\nThis can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n$$\n\\text{Coconut trees} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Mango trees} - 5\n$$\n\nSubstituting the known value of mango trees:\n\n$$\n\\text{Coconut trees} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 60 - 5 = 30 - 5 = 25\n$$\n\nSo, Randy has **25 coconut trees**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Total Number of Trees\n\nTo find the total number of trees on the farm, we add the number of mango trees and coconut trees:\n\n$$\n\\text{Total trees} = \\text{Mango trees} + \\text{Coconut trees} = 60 + 25 = 85\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{85}\n$$", "final_answer": "85", "num_tokens": 1015, "num_reasoning_steps": 28, "activations_path": "results_thinking/embeddings/q_0012_4b_activations.npz"}

The question is asking how much he spends in total on the ingredients. Let me break down the information given step by step.\n\nFirst, he buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10. So, the cheddar cheese costs $10 for 2 pounds. Then there's a pound of cream cheese, which costs half the price of the cheddar cheese. And then a pack of cold cuts that cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese. Hmm, I need to figure out the total cost by calculating each item's price and then adding them up.\n\nWait, let me make sure I understand. The cheddar cheese is $10 for 2 pounds. But does that mean per pound or total? The problem says he buys 2 pounds for $10, so the total cost for the cheddar is $10. Then the cream cheese is a pound, and its price is half the price of the cheddar cheese. Wait, is the price per pound or total? The problem says \"half the price of the cheddar cheese.\" Hmm. Let me think.\n\nThe cheddar cheese is $10 for 2 pounds. So, if we want to find the price per pound for cheddar, that would be $10 divided by 2 pounds, which is $5 per pound. But the problem says the cream cheese costs half the price of the cheddar cheese. Wait, does that mean half the price per pound or half the total price? The wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the original problem again.\n\n\"Jasper buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10, a pound of cream cheese that cost half the price of the cheddar cheese, and a pack of cold cuts that cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese.\"\n\nSo, the cream cheese is a pound, and it costs half the price of the cheddar cheese. The cheddar cheese is $10 for 2 pounds. So, is the price of the cream cheese half of $10, or half of the price per pound?\n\nThis is a crucial point. If the cream cheese is half the price of the cheddar cheese, then we need to know what \"the price of the cheddar cheese\" refers to. If it's the total price for the cheddar (which is $10), then the cream cheese would be $5. But if it's the price per pound, then the cheddar is $5 per pound, so half of that would be $2.50 per pound. But the cream cheese is a pound, so that would be $2.50.\n\nBut the problem says \"half the price of the cheddar cheese.\" Since the cheddar cheese is bought for $10 for 2 pounds, maybe the price here refers to the total price? Or maybe the price per pound? Hmm. Let me think again.\n\nIn common language, when someone says \"half the price of the cheddar cheese,\" they might mean half the price per pound. But maybe not. Let me check the problem again. The problem says he buys 2 pounds of cheddar for $10. Then the cream cheese is a pound that costs half the price of the cheddar cheese. So, if the cheddar is $10 for 2 pounds, then the price per pound is $5. If the cream cheese is half the price per pound, then it's $2.50 per pound. Since he's buying a pound of cream cheese, that would be $2.50. Alternatively, if \"half the price of the cheddar cheese\" refers to the total price, then it would be $5 for the cream cheese. But that seems less likely because the cheddar is a quantity (2 pounds) and the cream cheese is a different quantity (1 pound). So, maybe the price per pound is being compared.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the total price of the cheddar cheese, which is $10, so half of that is $5. But then the cream cheese is a pound, so if it's $5, that would be the total price for the cream cheese. But that would be a bit strange because the cheddar is $10 for 2 pounds, so $5 per pound. If the cream cheese is half the price of the cheddar cheese, then maybe it's $2.50 per pound. But the problem says \"a pound of cream cheese that cost half the price of the cheddar cheese.\" So, if the cheddar cheese is $10 for 2 pounds, then the price per pound is $5. So half of that is $2.50 per pound. Therefore, a pound of cream cheese would be $2.50. That seems logical.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is saying that the cream cheese is half the price of the cheddar cheese in total, then the cream cheese would be $5. But that would be a different interpretation. However, since the cheddar is a quantity (2 pounds) and the cream cheese is a different quantity (1 pound), it's more likely that the price per pound is being compared. So, the cream cheese is half the price per pound of the cheddar cheese.\n\nSimilarly, the cold cuts cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese. Again, if that refers to the price per pound, then twice $5 is $10 per pound. But the problem says \"a pack of cold cuts that cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese.\" So, again, if the cheddar cheese is $10 for 2 pounds, then the price per pound is $5. So twice that would be $10 per pound. But the cold cuts are a pack, not per pound. So, maybe the cold cuts are priced at twice the price of the cheddar cheese. If the cheddar cheese is $10 for 2 pounds, then twice that would be $20. But that would be if the cold cuts are priced at twice the total price of the cheddar cheese. Alternatively, if it's twice the price per pound, then $10 per pound.\n\nBut the problem is not clear. However, given that the cheddar cheese is given as a total price for 2 pounds, and the cream cheese is a pound, and the cold cuts are a pack, maybe the problem is referring to the total price of the cheddar cheese. Let me check the problem again:\n\n\"Jasper buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10, a pound of cream cheese that cost half the price of the cheddar cheese, and a pack of cold cuts that cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese.\"\n\nSo, the cheddar cheese is $10. The cream cheese is half the price of the cheddar cheese. So, if the cheddar cheese is $10, then the cream cheese is $5. The cold cuts are twice the price of the cheddar cheese, so $20. Then total would be 10 + 5 + 20 = $35. But that seems possible.\n\nBut then, why mention the pounds for the cheddar cheese? Because if the cream cheese is half the price of the cheddar cheese, maybe it's half the price per pound? But the problem says \"half the price of the cheddar cheese,\" not \"half the price per pound.\" So, maybe the total price of the cheddar cheese is $10, so the cream cheese is half that, which is $5. Then the cold cuts are twice that, which is $20. So total is 10 + 5 + 20 = $35.\n\nBut then, why mention the pounds? Because the problem says he buys 2 pounds of cheddar for $10. Maybe the price per pound is $5. Then, if the cream cheese is half the price per pound, that would be $2.50 per pound. Since he buys a pound, that's $2.50. Then the cold cuts are twice the price per pound of cheddar, which is $10 per pound. But the problem says \"a pack of cold cuts that cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese.\" If the cheddar cheese is $10 for 2 pounds, then twice that would be $20. But if it's twice the price per pound, then $10 per pound. But the problem doesn't specify whether the cold cuts are per pound or a pack. So, this is ambiguous.\n\nBut maybe the problem is intended to be straightforward. Let me check the problem again:\n\n\"Jasper buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10, a pound of cream cheese that cost half the price of the cheddar cheese, and a pack of cold cuts that cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese.\"\n\nSo, the cheddar cheese is $10 for 2 pounds. The cream cheese is a pound, and it costs half the price of the cheddar cheese. So, if the cheddar cheese is $10, then half of that is $5. So, the cream cheese is $5. Then the cold cuts are twice the price of the cheddar cheese, so twice $10 is $20. Therefore, total is 10 + 5 + 20 = $35.\n\nBut then, why mention the pounds? Because maybe the price of the cheddar cheese is per pound? But the problem says he buys 2 pounds for $10. So, if the price per pound is $5, then the cream cheese is half that, which is $2.50 per pound. Since he buys a pound, that's $2.50.

How many hours will it take her to read 120 pages?", "gold_answer": "5", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Joy can read 8 pages in 20 minutes. I need to figure out how long it will take her to read 120 pages. Hmm, so first, maybe I should find out how long it takes her to read one page, and then multiply that by 120? Or maybe there's another way. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, I can set up a proportion. If 8 pages take 20 minutes, then 120 pages would take x minutes. So, 8 pages / 20 minutes = 120 pages / x minutes? Wait, no, that might not be the right way. Actually, it should be pages over time, so maybe 8 pages / 20 minutes = 120 pages / x minutes. But actually, since more pages would take more time, maybe I need to set up the ratio as pages to time. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find her reading rate first. So, if she reads 8 pages in 20 minutes, then her rate is 8 pages per 20 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads per minute, I can divide 8 by 20. That would be 0.4 pages per minute. Then, if I want to know how long it takes to read 120 pages, I can divide 120 by her rate. So 120 divided by 0.4. Let me calculate that. 120 divided by 0.4 is the same as 120 multiplied by 2.5, which is 300 minutes. Then, converting minutes to hours, divide by 60. 300 divided by 60 is 5 hours. So, is it 5 hours?\n\nWait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through it step by step.\n\nFirst, find the rate. 8 pages in 20 minutes. So, pages per minute is 8/20. Simplify that fraction. 8 divided by 20 is 0.4 pages per minute. So, that's correct. Then, to find the time to read 120 pages, time equals pages divided by rate. So, 120 / 0.4. Let me compute that again. 0.4 times 300 is 120, because 0.4 times 100 is 40, so 0.4 times 300 is 120. So, 300 minutes. Then, converting minutes to hours: 300 divided by 60 is 5. So, 5 hours. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using proportions. If 8 pages take 20 minutes, then 120 pages take x minutes. So, set up the proportion 8/20 = 120/x. Wait, but that would be incorrect because if you have more pages, the time should be more, so actually, it should be 8 pages / 20 minutes = 120 pages / x minutes. Wait, but that would mean cross-multiplying 8x = 20*120. So, 8x = 2400. Then x = 2400 / 8 = 300 minutes. Which is the same as before. So, 300 minutes is 5 hours. So that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think in terms of how many sets of 8 pages are in 120 pages. 120 divided by 8 is 15. So, she reads 8 pages in 20 minutes, so 15 sets would take 15 times 20 minutes. 15*20 is 300 minutes, which is again 5 hours. So, same answer. So, that seems to confirm it.\n\nSo, all methods lead to 300 minutes, which is 5 hours. Therefore, the answer is 5 hours.\n\nBut let me check once more. Maybe I can check with a different approach. Let's say, how many minutes per page? 20 minutes for 8 pages. So, per page, it's 20/8 = 2.5 minutes per page. Then, 120 pages would take 120 * 2.5 minutes. Let's calculate that. 120 * 2.5. Well, 100 * 2.5 is 250, and 20 * 2.5 is 50, so total is 250 + 50 = 300 minutes. Again, 300 minutes is 5 hours. Yep, same answer.\n\nSo, all different ways of approaching the problem give me 5 hours. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Maybe I can check with a smaller number. For example, if she reads 8 pages in 20 minutes, then 16 pages would take 40 minutes. Which is 20*2. So, 16 pages is 2 sets of 8 pages. So, 2*20=40. Similarly, 24 pages would be 3*20=60 minutes. So, 120 pages is 15 sets of 8 pages. 15*20=300 minutes. So, that's 5 hours. Yep, that seems to check out.\n\nAlternatively, if I convert the rate to pages per hour. Since she reads 8 pages in 20 minutes, how many pages per hour? There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 20 minutes is 1/3 of an hour. So, in 1/3 of an hour, she reads 8 pages. Therefore, in 1 hour, she reads 8 / (1/3) = 24 pages per hour. So, 24 pages per hour. Then, to read 120 pages, time is 120 / 24 = 5 hours. That's another way to get the same answer. So, that's consistent.\n\nSo, all methods lead to 5 hours. Therefore, I think the answer is 5 hours. I don't see any errors in my reasoning. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nIt will take Joy \\boxed{5} hours to read 120 pages.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many hours it will take Joy to read 120 pages, we begin by analyzing her reading rate.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Determine Joy's Reading Rate\n\nJoy reads **8 pages in 20 minutes**. To find her reading rate in **pages per minute**, we divide:\n\n$$\n\\text{Rate} = \\frac{8 \\text{ pages}}{20 \\text{ minutes}} = 0.4 \\text{ pages per minute}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Time to Read 120 Pages\n\nNow that we know she reads 0.4 pages per minute, we can find the time it takes to read 120 pages by dividing:\n\n$$\n\\text{Time (in minutes)} = \\frac{120 \\text{ pages}}{0.4 \\text{ pages per minute}} = 300 \\text{ minutes}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Convert Minutes to Hours\n\nTo convert 300 minutes into hours, divide by 60:\n\n$$\n\\text{Time (in hours)} = \\frac{300 \\text{ minutes}}{60} = 5 \\text{ hours}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{5}\n$$", "final_answer": "5", "num_tokens": 1682, "num_reasoning_steps": 25, "activations_path": "results_thinking/embeddings/q_0014_4b_activations.npz"}

Hmm, first, I need to understand all the numbers given here. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nSo, James creates a movie for $2000. Wait, is that the initial cost for making the movie, or is that the cost per DVD? The problem says \"creates a movie for $2000.\" Hmm, maybe that's the one-time cost to make the movie? But then it also says each DVD costs $6 to make. So maybe the $2000 is something else? Wait, maybe the $2000 is the cost to create the movie, and then each DVD has a production cost of $6? Or is the $2000 the cost per DVD? Wait, the wording is a bit confusing here.\n\nLet me read again: \"He creates a movie for $2000. Each DVD cost $6 to make. He sells it for 2.5 times that much.\" So, maybe the $2000 is the initial cost to create the movie, and then each DVD costs $6 to make. So, the $2000 is a one-time cost? Or is it per movie? Wait, maybe the $2000 is the cost to make the movie, and then each DVD is $6? But that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the $2000 is the cost to create the movie, and then each DVD is produced at $6. So, if he makes a movie, that's $2000, and then each DVD is $6 to make. But then, how does that relate? Maybe the $2000 is the cost to make the movie, and then each DVD is $6? But then, if he sells the movie, maybe he sells the DVD? Wait, maybe the $2000 is the cost to produce the movie, and then each DVD is $6 to make. But that seems like maybe the $2000 is a one-time cost for the movie, and then each DVD is $6. But then, if he sells the movie, maybe he sells the DVD? Wait, maybe the $2000 is the cost to create the movie, and then each DVD is $6 to make. So, if he sells the DVD, he sells it for 2.5 times the cost to make it. So, the selling price per DVD is 2.5 times $6, which is $15? Let me check that.\n\nSo, the problem says: \"He sells it for 2.5 times that much.\" The \"that much\" refers to the cost to make each DVD, which is $6. So, selling price per DVD is 2.5 * $6 = $15. So, each DVD is sold for $15. Then, the profit per DVD would be selling price minus cost to make it, so $15 - $6 = $9 per DVD. But then, what about the initial cost of $2000? Is that a one-time cost? Or is that per movie?\n\nWait, the problem says \"He creates a movie for $2000.\" So, maybe that's the cost to create the movie, which is a one-time cost. Then, each DVD costs $6 to make. So, if he sells DVDs, each DVD is $6 to make, and sells for $15. So, the profit per DVD is $9. But then, how does the $2000 factor into this? Is that a fixed cost? Or is that the cost per movie?\n\nWait, maybe the $2000 is the cost to make the movie, and then each DVD is $6. But if he sells the movie, maybe he sells it as a physical DVD? So, maybe the $2000 is the cost to produce the movie, and then each DVD is $6. But that seems like maybe the $2000 is the cost to make the movie, and then each DVD is produced at $6. But if he sells the movie, maybe he sells it as a DVD, so the $2000 is the cost to make the movie, and then each DVD is $6? But that would mean that the $2000 is a one-time cost, and then each DVD is $6. But then, if he sells 500 movies a day for 5 days a week, how does that relate?\n\nWait, maybe the $2000 is the cost to create the movie, and then each DVD is $6. So, if he sells 500 DVDs a day, then the total cost per week would be the $2000 plus the cost of producing the DVDs. But that seems like maybe the $2000 is a fixed cost, and then the DVD production is variable. But the problem says \"He creates a movie for $2000.\" Maybe that's the cost to make the movie, and then each DVD is $6. So, if he sells the movie, maybe he sells it as a DVD, so the $2000 is the cost to make the movie, and then each DVD is $6. But that would mean that the $2000 is a one-time cost, and then each DVD is $6. But then, if he sells 500 DVDs a day, then the total cost would be $2000 plus 500 DVDs * $6 per DVD. But then, the problem says he sells 500 movies a day. Wait, maybe \"movie\" here refers to the DVD? Maybe the movie is the product, and each DVD is a copy of the movie. So, the initial cost to create the movie is $2000, and then each DVD costs $6 to make. So, the $2000 is a one-time cost, and then each DVD is $6. Then, the selling price is 2.5 times the cost to make each DVD, which is $15. So, profit per DVD is $15 - $6 = $9. Then, total profit would be (number of DVDs sold) * $9 minus the initial cost of $2000? Or is the initial cost included in the total cost?\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me try to parse the problem again:\n\n\"James creates a media empire. He creates a movie for $2000. Each DVD cost $6 to make. He sells it for 2.5 times that much. He sells 500 movies a day for 5 days a week. How much profit does he make in 20 weeks?\"\n\nSo, \"creates a movie for $2000\"\u2014maybe that's the cost to make the movie, which is a one-time cost. Then, each DVD costs $6 to make. So, if he sells DVDs, each DVD is $6 to produce. Then, he sells each DVD for 2.5 times that much, so 2.5 * $6 = $15. So, selling price is $15 per DVD. Then, he sells 500 movies a day. Wait, \"movies\" here\u2014maybe that's the same as DVDs? So, he sells 500 DVDs a day. Then, 5 days a week, so 500 * 5 = 2500 DVDs per week. Then, over 20 weeks, that's 2500 * 20 = 50,000 DVDs. \n\nBut then, profit would be total revenue minus total cost. Total revenue is number of DVDs sold times selling price. Total cost is initial cost of creating the movie ($2000) plus the cost of producing all the DVDs. Wait, but is the initial cost of creating the movie a one-time cost? If he creates the movie once, then the $2000 is a fixed cost. Then, the cost of producing the DVDs is $6 per DVD. So, total cost is $2000 + (number of DVDs sold * $6). Then, total revenue is number of DVDs sold * $15. Then, profit is total revenue minus total cost.\n\nBut wait, maybe the $2000 is the cost to create the movie, which is a one-time cost, and then each DVD is $6. So, if he sells 500 DVDs a day, then over 20 weeks, he sells 500 * 5 * 20 = 50,000 DVDs. So, total revenue is 50,000 * $15. Total cost is $2000 + 50,000 * $6. Then, profit is total revenue minus total cost.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $2000 is the cost per movie? But that seems unlikely. The problem says \"He creates a movie for $2000.\" So, maybe that's the cost to make the movie, which is a one-time cost. Then, each DVD is $6 to make. So, the $2000 is a fixed cost, and the DVD production is variable. So, that seems to be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $2000 is the cost to make each DVD? But that would conflict with \"each DVD cost $6 to make.\" So, that can't be. Therefore, the $2000 is a one-time cost to create the movie, and then each DVD is $6 to make.

If Johnson got $2500, how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?", "gold_answer": "800", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about sharing a profit between two business partners, Mike and Johnson, in the ratio 2:5. Johnson received $2500, and we need to find out how much Mike will have after he spends $200 on a shirt. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the profit is divided in the ratio 2:5 between Mike and Johnson. That means for every 2 parts Mike gets, Johnson gets 5 parts. So the total parts would be 2 + 5 = 7 parts. Right? So the total profit is divided into 7 parts, with Mike getting 2 parts and Johnson getting 5 parts.\n\nNow, Johnson's share is $2500, which corresponds to 5 parts. So if 5 parts equal $2500, then each part must be equal to $2500 divided by 5. Let me calculate that. 2500 divided by 5 is 500. So each part is $500. Therefore, Mike's share, which is 2 parts, would be 2 times 500, which is $1000. Wait, is that right? Let me check again.\n\nIf 5 parts = $2500, then 1 part = 2500 / 5 = 500. Then Mike's 2 parts would be 2 * 500 = $1000. Yeah, that seems correct. So Mike originally gets $1000.\n\nBut then the question says Mike spends some of his share on a shirt that costs $200. So we need to find out how much he has left after buying the shirt. So if he had $1000 and spends $200, then he would have 1000 - 200 = $800 left. So the answer should be $800?\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. The ratio is 2:5, so total parts 7. Johnson's 5 parts is $2500. So each part is 500. Mike's part is 2 parts, so 1000. Then he spends 200, so 1000 - 200 = 800. Yeah, that seems straightforward.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe there's a trick here? Like, is the total profit something else? Or is there any other information I need to consider? The problem says the profit is shared between them in the ratio 2:5. So Johnson's share is 5 parts, which is $2500. So the total profit would be 7 parts, which would be 7 * 500 = $3500. But maybe that's not necessary here. The question is only about Mike's share after he spends money. So Mike's original share is $1000, spends $200, so $800. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if the ratio is Mike:Johnson 2:5, so Mike gets 2/7 of the total profit, Johnson gets 5/7. So if Johnson's share is $2500, then total profit is (2500 / 5/7) = 2500 * 7/5 = 3500. Then Mike's share is 2/7 of 3500, which is 1000. Same result. Then subtract 200, so 800. Yep, same answer.\n\nSo I think that's correct. Maybe the answer is $800. Let me just check once more.\n\nTotal ratio parts: 2 + 5 = 7. Johnson's 5 parts = $2500. So 1 part = 500. Mike's 2 parts = 1000. After spending 200, 1000 - 200 = 800. Yep. I think that's solid. No mistakes here.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe amount Mike will have after buying the shirt is \\boxed{800}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the profit-sharing ratio between Mike and Johnson, which is given as **2:5**. This means that for every 2 parts of profit that Mike receives, Johnson receives 5 parts.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Value of One Part\n\nWe are told that Johnson received **$2500**, which corresponds to **5 parts** of the profit. To find the value of one part, we divide Johnson's share by the number of parts:\n\n$$\n\\text{Value of one part} = \\frac{2500}{5} = 500\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Mike's Share\n\nSince Mike's share is **2 parts**, we multiply the value of one part by 2:\n\n$$\n\\text{Mike's share} = 2 \\times 500 = 1000\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Subtract the Cost of the Shirt\n\nMike spends **$200** on a shirt.

I need to figure out how many hard hats are left in the truck after Carl and John take some away. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the truck initially has 26 pink hard hats, 15 green ones, and 24 yellow ones. So, the total number of hard hats at the beginning is 26 + 15 + 24. Let me calculate that. 26 plus 15 is 41, and 41 plus 24 is 65. So there are 65 hard hats in total initially.\n\nNow, Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats. So, the number of pink hard hats after Carl takes his share would be 26 minus 4. Let me write that down: 26 - 4 = 22 pink hard hats remaining.\n\nThen, John takes away 6 pink hard hats and twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats he removed. Hmm, okay. So John takes 6 pink hard hats. Wait, but Carl already took 4 pink hard hats. So, does that mean there are 22 pink hard hats left after Carl, and then John takes 6 more? Let me check.\n\nYes, the problem says Carl takes away 4 pink, then John takes away 6 pink and some green. So, the pink hard hats are being taken away in two steps. So, first, Carl takes 4, then John takes 6. So total pink taken away is 4 + 6 = 10. Therefore, the remaining pink hard hats would be 26 - 10 = 16. Wait, but let me verify that again. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate after each step.\n\nOriginal pink: 26.\n\nAfter Carl takes 4: 26 - 4 = 22.\n\nThen John takes 6 pink: 22 - 6 = 16. Yes, that's correct. So 16 pink hard hats left.\n\nNow, for the green hard hats. John takes twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats he removed. John removed 6 pink hard hats. So twice that is 2 * 6 = 12 green hard hats. Therefore, John takes away 12 green hard hats.\n\nOriginal green hard hats were 15. So after John takes 12, the remaining green hard hats would be 15 - 12 = 3.\n\nYellow hard hats are not mentioned as being taken away by anyone, so they remain at 24.\n\nSo, total remaining hard hats would be pink + green + yellow.\n\nPink: 16, green: 3, yellow: 24. Let me add those up. 16 + 3 is 19, and 19 + 24 is 43. So total of 43 hard hats remaining.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through each step again.\n\nOriginal counts:\n\nPink: 26\n\nGreen: 15\n\nYellow: 24\n\nTotal: 26 + 15 + 24 = 65. Correct.\n\nCarl takes away 4 pink. So pink becomes 26 - 4 = 22. Correct.\n\nJohn takes away 6 pink and twice as many green as the pink he took. So John takes 6 pink and 2*6=12 green. So, subtracting those from the respective colors.\n\nPink after John: 22 - 6 = 16. Green after John: 15 - 12 = 3. Yellow remains 24.\n\nTotal remaining: 16 + 3 + 24 = 43. So 43.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total taken away and subtract from the original total.\n\nTotal taken away by Carl: 4 pink.\n\nTotal taken away by John: 6 pink + 12 green = 18 hard hats.\n\nTotal taken away altogether: 4 + 18 = 22.\n\nOriginal total was 65. So 65 - 22 = 43. Same answer. So that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 43. Let me check once more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated the green hats? Original green is 15.

{"question_id": "q_0018", "model_name": "qwen3-4b", "model_params": "4B", "question": "It takes Roque two hours to walk to work and one hour to ride his bike to work. Roque walks to and from work three times a week and rides his bike to and from work twice a week. How many hours in total does he take to get to and from work a week with walking and biking?", "gold_answer": "16", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how many hours Roque spends getting to and from work each week. So, the problem says that it takes him two hours to walk to work and one hour to ride his bike. He walks to and from work three times a week, and rides his bike to and from work twice a week. Hmm, I need to calculate the total time he spends on all these trips.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Roque has two modes of transportation: walking and biking. Each week, he does a combination of walking and biking for his commute. Specifically, he walks to and from work three times a week. Wait, does that mean three one-way trips? Or three round trips? The wording says \"three times a week\" for walking to and from work. Hmm. Let me think. If he walks to and from work three times a week, that would mean three round trips, right? Because each time he goes to work and comes back, that's a round trip. So, for example, if he walks to work and back home, that's one trip. So three times a week, that would be three round trips. Similarly, he rides his bike to and from work twice a week, so that's two round trips.\n\nBut let me check again. The problem says: \"Roque walks to and from work three times a week and rides his bike to and from work twice a week.\" So, \"to and from\" implies a round trip. So, each time he walks to and from work, that's one instance. So, three times a week walking, meaning three round trips. Similarly, two times a week biking, meaning two round trips.\n\nSo, for each round trip, walking takes 2 hours one way, so round trip would be 2 hours times 2, which is 4 hours. Similarly, biking is 1 hour one way, so round trip is 2 hours.\n\nTherefore, for walking: 3 round trips * 4 hours per round trip = 12 hours.\n\nFor biking: 2 round trips * 2 hours per round trip = 4 hours.\n\nThen total time per week is 12 + 4 = 16 hours.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I need to think about it differently. Maybe \"three times a week\" refers to one-way trips? But the wording says \"walks to and from work three times a week\". So, if he walks to work and back, that's one time. So three times a week, that would be three round trips. Similarly for biking.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that \"to and from\" is one trip, so each time he does that, it's a round trip. So, for example, if he walks to work and back, that's one trip. So three times a week, that's three trips. So, each trip is a round trip. Therefore, the calculation above is correct.\n\nBut let me think again. Suppose he walks to work three times a week. But then, does he also walk back? The problem says \"walks to and from work three times a week\". So, each time he does \"to and from\", which is a round trip. Therefore, three round trips walking, two round trips biking.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that \"three times a week\" is for each direction? But that would be different. For example, if he walks to work three times a week and walks back three times a week. But that would be six one-way trips. But the problem says \"walks to and from work three times a week\", which is more likely to mean three round trips.\n\nBut maybe I need to check the exact wording again. The problem says: \"Roque walks to and from work three times a week and rides his bike to and from work twice a week.\" So, \"walks to and from work\" three times a week. So, each time he does that, it's a round trip. So, three round trips walking. Similarly, two round trips biking.\n\nTherefore, for each round trip walking, it's 2 hours each way, so 4 hours total. Three times that is 12 hours. For biking, each round trip is 1 hour each way, so 2 hours total. Two times that is 4 hours. So total is 12 + 4 = 16 hours per week.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe the problem is considering that \"to and from\" is one way? No, that doesn't make sense. To and from is a round trip. So, for example, if you go to work and come back, that's to and from. So, each time he does that, it's a round trip.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that he walks to work three times a week, and walks back three times a week? But that would be different. But the problem says \"walks to and from work three times a week\", which is more naturally interpreted as three round trips.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in translation? The original problem is in English, so maybe not. Let me think of another way. Suppose that \"three times a week\" is for each direction. So, he walks to work three times a week, and walks back three times a week. But that would be six one-way trips. But then, the problem says \"walks to and from work three times a week\", which is a bit ambiguous. However, in common language, \"to and from\" would mean a round trip. So, if you say \"I go to and from work three times a week\", that would mean three round trips.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that he walks to work three times a week, and rides his bike to and from work twice a week. Wait, but the problem says \"walks to and from work three times a week and rides his bike to and from work twice a week.\" So, both actions are \"to and from\", so three times for walking, two times for biking.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is as before: 3 round trips walking, each taking 4 hours, so 12 hours. 2 round trips biking, each taking 2 hours, so 4 hours. Total 16 hours.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Let's think about one-way trips. Suppose that for walking, he does \"to and from\" three times a week. So, each \"to and from\" is two one-way trips. Therefore, three times a week would be 3 * 2 = 6 one-way trips. Similarly, for biking, two times a week \"to and from\" would be 2 * 2 = 4 one-way trips.\n\nThen, total one-way trips: 6 walking + 4 biking. But then, each one-way trip is either walking or biking. However, the problem is that the time for each one-way trip is different. So, for walking, each one-way trip is 2 hours, and for biking, each one-way trip is 1 hour.\n\nTherefore, total time would be: 6 trips * 2 hours + 4 trips * 1 hour = 12 + 4 = 16 hours. Same result. So that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of it as per round trip, then for walking, 3 round trips, each taking 2 hours each way, so 4 hours per round trip. 3 * 4 = 12. For biking, 2 round trips, each taking 1 hour each way, so 2 hours per round trip. 2 * 2 = 4. Total 16. Same answer.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach, the answer is 16 hours.\n\nBut let me check again if there's any possible misunderstanding. For example, maybe \"three times a week\" is for each direction? Like, he walks to work three times a week and walks back three times a week. But that would be 6 one-way trips. But then, the problem says \"walks to and from work three times a week\", which is more naturally interpreted as three round trips. However, if someone says \"I walk to and from work three times a week\", it could be interpreted as three times going to work and three times coming back? But that would be inconsistent. Because \"to and from\" is a single trip. So, if you say \"I go to and from work three times a week\", that would mean three times going to work and coming back. So, three round trips.\n\nAlternatively, if he walks to work three times a week and walks back three times a week, that would be different. But that would be six one-way trips. However, the problem says \"walks to and from work three times a week\", which is more likely to mean three round trips. Therefore, the answer is 16 hours.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the translation. Let me check the original problem again:\n\n\"It takes Roque two hours to walk to work and one hour to ride his bike to work. Roque walks to and from work three times a week and rides his bike to and from work twice a week. How many hours in total does he take to get to and from work a week with walking and biking?\"\n\nSo, the key is \"walks to and from work three times a week\". So, each time he does \"to and from\", which is a round trip. Therefore, three round trips walking, two round trips biking. Therefore, total time is 3*(2+2) + 2*(1+1) = 3*4 + 2*2 = 12 + 4 = 16.

He also goes for a weekend bike ride of 200 miles.    If he can bike at 25 mph how much time does he spend biking a week?", "gold_answer": "16", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out how much time Tim spends biking each week. So, first, let me parse the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nTim rides his bike back and forth to work for each of his 5 workdays. His work is 20 miles away. Then, he also goes for a weekend bike ride of 200 miles. He can bike at 25 mph. The question is asking how much time he spends biking a week.\n\nAlright, so I need to calculate the total time he spends biking during the week, considering both his commutes to work and the weekend ride. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's handle the workdays. He goes to work 5 days a week, right? Each day he rides back and forth. The distance to work is 20 miles. So, going to work is 20 miles, and coming back is another 20 miles. Therefore, each day he rides 20 + 20 = 40 miles. Wait, is that correct? Let me confirm. If his work is 20 miles away, then going to work is 20 miles, and coming back is another 20 miles. So yes, each day he bikes 40 miles. Therefore, for 5 workdays, the total distance for commutes would be 5 days multiplied by 40 miles per day. Let me write that down:\n\nTotal distance for workdays = 5 days * 40 miles/day = 200 miles.\n\nWait, hold on. But then he also has a weekend bike ride of 200 miles. So total distance for the week would be 200 miles (commutes) + 200 miles (weekend ride) = 400 miles total. Then, since he bikes at 25 mph, the total time would be total distance divided by speed. So 400 miles / 25 mph = 16 hours. Is that right? Wait, but let me check again because sometimes these problems have tricks.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in calculating the distance for the workdays. Let me check again. Each workday, he goes to work and comes back. So that's two trips per day. Each trip is 20 miles. So per day, 2*20 = 40 miles. For 5 days, 5*40 = 200 miles. Then the weekend ride is 200 miles. So total distance is 200 + 200 = 400 miles. Then time is distance divided by speed. 400 divided by 25 is 16 hours. So 16 hours total. That seems straightforward, but let me check if there's something I missed.\n\nWait, the problem says \"back and forth to work for each of his 5 workdays.\" So maybe \"back and forth\" is considered as one trip? Wait, no. If you go to work and come back, that's two trips. But maybe the problem is considering \"back and forth\" as a single trip? Wait, no, usually \"back and forth\" would mean going and coming back. So for example, if you go to work and come back, that's one round trip. So the distance is 20 miles each way, so 40 miles per day. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that \"back and forth\" is one way? But that doesn't make sense. If you go to work and come back, that's two ways. So I think my calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the weekend ride is 200 miles, but is that a single trip or multiple? The problem says \"a weekend bike ride of 200 miles,\" so that's a single ride of 200 miles. So that's straightforward.\n\nSo total distance is 200 + 200 = 400 miles. Then time is 400 divided by 25. Let me compute that. 25 mph means 25 miles per hour. So 25 miles in one hour. Therefore, 400 divided by 25 is 16. So 16 hours. Therefore, the answer is 16 hours. But let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to calculate the time for each part separately and then add them up. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, the workdays. Each day, 40 miles. At 25 mph, time per day is distance divided by speed. So 40 miles / 25 mph = 1.6 hours per day. Then for 5 days, that's 5 * 1.6 hours. Let me compute that. 5 * 1.6 is 8 hours. Then the weekend ride is 200 miles. Time for that is 200 / 25 = 8 hours. Then total time is 8 + 8 = 16 hours. So same answer. So that seems to confirm it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if the weekend ride is on Saturday and Sunday, but the problem says \"weekend bike ride,\" so that's one ride. So 200 miles. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the weekend ride is 200 miles, but is that 200 miles total or something else? The problem says \"a weekend bike ride of 200 miles,\" so that's 200 miles. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the workdays are 5 days, but maybe he doesn't bike on weekends? But the problem says he also goes for a weekend bike ride, so that's separate. So the total time is 5 days of commuting plus 1 weekend ride.\n\nSo, yes, 5 days * 40 miles/day = 200 miles. 200 miles / 25 mph = 8 hours. Then 200 miles / 25 mph = 8 hours. Total 16 hours. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if the speed is 25 mph, so 25 miles per hour. So for example, 25 miles in one hour. So 40 miles would take 40 / 25 = 1.6 hours, which is 1 hour and 36 minutes. Then 5 days would be 5 * 1.6 hours = 8 hours. Then 200 miles would be 8 hours. So total 16 hours. So that's 16 hours total. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the answer in hours and minutes? But the question says \"how much time does he spend biking a week?\" and it doesn't specify the format, but since the answer is 16 hours, which is a whole number, probably acceptable. But let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the distance for the workdays. Let me check again. If work is 20 miles away, then going to work is 20 miles, coming back is 20 miles. So per day, 40 miles. 5 days, 200 miles. Then weekend ride 200 miles. Total 400 miles. 400 divided by 25 is 16. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that \"back and forth\" is considered as one way? But that would be incorrect. If you go to work and come back, that's two ways. So 20 miles each way. So 40 miles per day. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the weekend ride is 200 miles, but maybe that's 200 miles total? But the problem says \"a weekend bike ride of 200 miles,\" so that's 200 miles. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that he bikes to work and back, but maybe he doesn't bike on weekends? But the problem says he also goes for a weekend bike ride, so that's separate. So that's 200 miles. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. 16 hours.\n\nBut let me check once more with another approach. Let's compute the time for each part.\n\nFirst, workdays: 5 days. Each day, 20 miles to work and 20 miles back. So 40 miles per day. At 25 mph, time per day is 40 / 25 = 1.6 hours. 1.6 hours is 1 hour and 36 minutes. So 5 days would be 5 * 1.6 = 8 hours. Then the weekend ride is 200 miles. 200 / 25 = 8 hours. So total time is 8 + 8 = 16 hours. So that's 16 hours. So that's the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the interpretation of \"back and forth\". If \"back and forth\" is considered as one trip, but that would be 20 miles each way. But that's still 40 miles. So no difference.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that he bikes to work and back, but maybe he doesn't bike on weekends? But the problem says he also goes for a weekend ride. So that's separate. So that's 200 miles.

She bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, and 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. How many stamps did Bella buy in all?", "gold_answer": "38", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Bella bought stamps with three different designs: snowflake, truck, and rose. The problem gives me some numbers, and I need to find the total number of stamps she bought. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps. So, that's straightforward. Let me note that down:\n\nSnowflake stamps (S) = 11.\n\nThen, it says she bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Hmm, so truck stamps (T) are 9 more than snowflake. Since snowflake is 11, then truck stamps would be 11 + 9. Let me calculate that: 11 + 9 is 20. So, truck stamps are 20. Let me write that:\n\nTruck stamps (T) = S + 9 = 11 + 9 = 20.\n\nNext, it mentions that she bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So, rose stamps (R) are truck stamps minus 13. Since truck stamps are 20, then rose stamps would be 20 - 13. Let me do that math: 20 - 13 is 7. So, rose stamps are 7. Let me note that:\n\nRose stamps (R) = T - 13 = 20 - 13 = 7.\n\nNow, to find the total number of stamps, I need to add up all three types: snowflake, truck, and rose. So total stamps (Total) = S + T + R.\n\nPlugging in the numbers I have:\n\nTotal = 11 (snowflake) + 20 (truck) + 7 (rose).\n\nLet me add those up. 11 + 20 is 31, and 31 + 7 is 38. So, the total number of stamps Bella bought is 38.\n\nWait, let me check if I did everything correctly. Let me go through each step again.\n\nFirst, snowflake is 11. Then truck is 9 more than snowflake. 11 + 9 is indeed 20. Then rose is 13 fewer than truck. 20 - 13 is 7. Then adding them up: 11 + 20 + 7. 11 + 20 is 31, plus 7 is 38. That seems right.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't misread any part of the problem. The problem says \"9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps\"\u2014yes, that's what I used. And \"13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps\"\u2014yes, that's what I did. So, seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check with variables. Let me try that.\n\nLet S = snowflake stamps = 11.\n\nT = truck stamps = S + 9 = 11 + 9 = 20.\n\nR = rose stamps = T - 13 = 20 - 13 = 7.\n\nTotal = S + T + R = 11 + 20 + 7 = 38. Yep, same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\n\nTotal = S + (S + 9) + (S + 9 - 13). Wait, no. Wait, R is T - 13, which is (S + 9) - 13. So, substituting:\n\nTotal = S + (S + 9) + (S + 9 - 13) = S + S + 9 + S + 9 - 13.\n\nCombine like terms: 3S + (9 + 9 - 13) = 3S + 5.\n\nSince S is 11, then total is 3*11 + 5 = 33 + 5 = 38. Same answer. So that's another way to check. So that seems to confirm it.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 38. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. All steps check out.

I need to figure out how many beetles are eaten each day in this forest with jaguars, snakes, and birds. Let me start by breaking down the information given.\n\nFirst, each bird eats 12 beetles per day. Then, each snake eats 3 birds per day. And each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day. There are 6 jaguars in the forest. The question is asking for the total number of beetles eaten each day. \n\nHmm, so it seems like this is a chain of predation. Jaguars eat snakes, snakes eat birds, and birds eat beetles. So, to find the total beetles eaten, I need to figure out how many birds are eaten by snakes, then how many snakes are eaten by jaguars, and then how that translates to beetles. Wait, but actually, the beetles are eaten by the birds. So maybe I need to find out how many birds there are, then multiply by 12? But wait, the problem doesn't mention the number of birds or snakes. Hmm, maybe I need to calculate the number of birds that are eaten by snakes, and then the number of snakes eaten by jaguars, and then figure out how that affects the beetles?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again. The problem says \"how many beetles are eaten each day?\" So, beetles are eaten by birds. So, if I can find out how many birds are there, then multiply by 12, that would give me the total beetles eaten. But the problem doesn't give me the number of birds. However, maybe the number of birds is determined by the number of snakes eaten by jaguars, and the number of snakes is determined by the number of jaguars?\n\nWait, let me try to structure this step by step.\n\nFirst, each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day. There are 6 jaguars. So, the total number of snakes eaten by jaguars per day would be 6 jaguars * 5 snakes/jaguar = 30 snakes per day. \n\nBut wait, does that mean that 30 snakes are eaten each day by the jaguars? So, if 30 snakes are eaten each day, then how does that affect the number of birds? Because each snake eats 3 birds per day. So, if there are 30 snakes being eaten, does that mean that those snakes are eating birds? Or is it that the snakes are being eaten by jaguars, and the snakes themselves are eating birds?\n\nI think the way the problem is structured is that each snake eats 3 birds per day. So, regardless of whether the snakes are being eaten by jaguars or not, each snake eats 3 birds per day. But if the snakes are being eaten by jaguars, then maybe the number of snakes is decreasing? But the problem is asking for how many beetles are eaten each day. So, maybe we need to find out how many birds are eaten by snakes each day, which would be the number of snakes multiplied by 3. But then, how many snakes are there?\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't give the total number of snakes or birds. It only gives the number of jaguars. So, maybe we need to assume that the number of snakes is determined by the number of jaguars? Or is there another way?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the jaguars are eating snakes, which in turn are eating birds, which are eating beetles. But the question is about how many beetles are eaten each day. So, perhaps we need to find the number of beetles eaten by the birds, which depends on the number of birds. But the number of birds depends on the number of snakes, which depends on the number of jaguars?\n\nBut how? If each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day, then the number of snakes eaten per day is 6 jaguars * 5 snakes/jaguar = 30 snakes per day. But does that mean that there are 30 snakes being eaten each day? So, if the snakes are being eaten by jaguars, then the number of snakes in the forest is not given. But maybe we need to assume that the number of snakes is equal to the number of snakes eaten per day? That doesn't make sense because if they are being eaten, the number of snakes would decrease. But maybe the problem is assuming that the number of snakes is sufficient to be eaten by the jaguars, and that the number of snakes is such that they are being eaten by the jaguars. But this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is not about the number of snakes being eaten, but about the number of snakes that are eating birds. So, if each snake eats 3 birds per day, then the total number of birds eaten by snakes per day is number of snakes * 3. But how many snakes are there?\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't mention the number of snakes. However, since each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day, and there are 6 jaguars, maybe the number of snakes is determined by the number of jaguars? But that seems unclear. Maybe the problem is assuming that the number of snakes is equal to the number of snakes eaten by jaguars? But that would be 30 snakes, but then if those snakes are eaten, then the number of snakes would be 30? But that seems like a possible assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the jaguars are eating snakes, which are eating birds, which are eating beetles. So, the number of beetles eaten is determined by the number of birds, which is determined by the number of snakes, which is determined by the number of jaguars. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day. So, if there are 6 jaguars, then each day, they eat 6*5=30 snakes. Therefore, the number of snakes that are eaten per day is 30. But if those snakes are being eaten, then the number of snakes in the forest is not given. However, if we assume that the number of snakes is equal to the number of snakes eaten per day, then that would be 30 snakes. But that seems like an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the number of snakes is such that they are being eaten by the jaguars, but the problem is not about the number of snakes, but about the number of snakes that are eating birds. So, if each snake eats 3 birds per day, then the number of birds eaten by snakes is 3 times the number of snakes. But how many snakes are there?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the number of snakes is equal to the number of snakes eaten by jaguars. But that would be 30 snakes. So, if there are 30 snakes, then each snake eats 3 birds per day, so total birds eaten by snakes is 30*3=90 birds per day. Then, each bird eats 12 beetles per day, so total beetles eaten is 90*12=1080 beetles per day. Is that the answer?\n\nBut wait, that seems like an assumption that the number of snakes is 30. But why would the number of snakes be 30? Because the jaguars eat 30 snakes per day. But if the jaguars are eating 30 snakes per day, that would mean that the number of snakes is sufficient to be eaten by the jaguars. However, if the number of snakes is more than 30, then the number of snakes eaten would be 30. But the problem doesn't specify the total number of snakes. So, maybe the problem is assuming that the number of snakes is equal to the number of snakes eaten by jaguars? That is, that the jaguars are eating 30 snakes per day, so there are 30 snakes in the forest? But that seems like an assumption. However, given that the problem doesn't provide any other numbers, maybe that's the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the number of snakes is not given, but the number of beetles eaten is determined by the number of birds, which is determined by the number of snakes, which is determined by the number of jaguars. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day. So, if there are 6 jaguars, then each day, they eat 6*5=30 snakes. Therefore, the number of snakes that are eaten per day is 30. Therefore, the number of snakes that are being eaten is 30. But if each snake eats 3 birds per day, then the number of birds eaten by snakes is 3*30=90 birds per day. Then, each bird eats 12 beetles per day, so the number of beetles eaten is 90*12=1080. Therefore, the answer is 1080.\n\nBut is this correct? Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the snakes are being eaten by jaguars, so the number of snakes is not directly related to the number of beetles. But the beetles are eaten by the birds. So, if the snakes are eating birds, then the number of birds depends on the number of snakes. But if the snakes are being eaten by jaguars, then the number of snakes is decreasing. However, the problem is asking for how many beetles are eaten each day. So, maybe we need to find the number of birds that are eaten by snakes each day, which would be 3 times the number of snakes. But how many snakes are there?\n\nBut the problem doesn't give the number of snakes.

If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie\u2019s. Jamie\u2019s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha\u2019s last name?", "gold_answer": "7", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how many letters are in Samantha's last name. Hmm, the problem says that Samantha\u2019s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie\u2019s. So if I can figure out how many letters are in Bobbie's last name, I can subtract three to get Samantha's. \n\nThen there's another part: If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie\u2019s. Jamie\u2019s full name is Jamie Grey. Wait, so Jamie's last name is Grey, right? Let me check. Jamie Grey \u2013 yeah, so Jamie's last name is Grey. How many letters is that? G-R-E-E-Y. That's 5 letters. So Jamie's last name has 5 letters.\n\nSo the problem says if Bobbie took two letters off her last name, it would be twice the length of Jamie's. So Jamie's is 5 letters, so twice that is 10 letters. Therefore, Bobbie's last name minus two letters equals 10 letters. So Bobbie's last name must be 10 + 2 = 12 letters long? Wait, let me make sure. If you take two letters off Bobbie's name, it becomes 10 letters. So original length is 10 + 2 = 12. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nSo Bobbie's last name has 12 letters. Then Samantha's last name has three fewer letters. So 12 - 3 = 9. Therefore, Samantha's last name has 9 letters? Let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, Jamie's last name is Grey, which is 5 letters. If Bobbie's last name minus two letters is twice Jamie's, so 2*5=10. Therefore, Bobbie's last name is 10 + 2 = 12 letters. Then Samantha's is 12 - 3 = 9. That seems straightforward. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way this could be interpreted. For example, maybe \"twice the length of Jamie\u2019s\" refers to Jamie's full name? But the problem says \"Jamie\u2019s last name is Grey,\" so I think it's referring to the last name. So Jamie's last name is 5 letters. So twice that is 10. So Bobbie's last name minus two letters is 10, so Bobbie's is 12. Then Samantha's is 12 - 3 = 9. \n\nIs there any chance that the problem is referring to Jamie's full name, which is Jamie Grey? So Jamie is 5 letters, Grey is 5 letters. So the full name is 5 + 5 = 10 letters? But the problem says \"twice the length of Jamie\u2019s.\" It says \"Jamie\u2019s last name is Grey,\" so I think it's specifically referring to the last name. So Jamie's last name is 5 letters. Therefore, twice that is 10. \n\nAlternatively, if someone misreads it as the full name, but the problem says \"If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie\u2019s.\" So it's specifically talking about the last name. So Jamie's last name is Grey, 5 letters. So that part seems solid.\n\nTherefore, Bobbie's last name is 12 letters. Samantha's is 3 fewer, so 9 letters. Therefore, the answer is 9. \n\nBut let me check again. Let me write equations. Let me assign variables. Let me let B be the number of letters in Bobbie's last name. Then Samantha's last name is B - 3. \n\nThen, if Bobbie takes two letters off her last name, her last name would be B - 2. And that is twice the length of Jamie's last name. Jamie's last name is Grey, which is 5 letters. Therefore:\n\nB - 2 = 2 * 5\n\nSo B - 2 = 10\n\nTherefore, B = 12. Then Samantha's last name is 12 - 3 = 9. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer is 9. \n\nI think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So Samantha's last name has 9 letters.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of letters in Samantha\u2019s last name is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many letters are in Samantha\u2019s last name, we need to analyze the relationships described in the problem step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand Jamie's Last Name\n\nThe problem states that Jamie\u2019s full name is **Jamie Grey**. We are specifically told that **Jamie\u2019s last name is Grey**. Counting the letters in \"Grey\":\n\n- G, R, E, E, Y \u2192 **5 letters**\n\nSo, **Jamie\u2019s last name has 5 letters**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use the Information About Bobbie\u2019s Last Name\n\nThe problem says:\n\n> If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie\u2019s.\n\nThis means:\n\n- Bobbie\u2019s last name minus 2 letters = 2 \u00d7 (Jamie\u2019s last name length)\n- 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n\nSo, Bobbie\u2019s last name minus 2 letters = 10 letters  \n\u2192 Bobbie\u2019s last name = 10 + 2 = **12 letters**\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Use the Relationship Between Samantha and Bobbie\n\nThe problem also states:\n\n> Samantha\u2019s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie\u2019s last name.\n\nSo:\n\n- Samantha\u2019s last name = Bobbie\u2019s last name \u2013 3  \n- Samantha\u2019s last name = 12 \u2013 3 = **9 letters**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{9}\n$$", "final_answer": "9", "num_tokens": 1246, "num_reasoning_steps": 37, "activations_path": "results_thinking/embeddings/q_0022_4b_activations.npz"}

For $75 she bought 5 pairs of shorts for $7 each and 2 pairs of shoes for $10 each. She also bought 4 tops, all at the same price. How much did each top cost?", "gold_answer": "5", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Ann bought a bunch of things at this store, and I need to figure out how much each top cost. Let me start by breaking down the information given.\n\nFirst, she spent a total of $75. That's the total amount she paid for everything. Then, she bought 5 pairs of shorts for $7 each. Hmm, so I should calculate how much she spent on the shorts. Let me write that down.\n\nShorts: 5 pairs * $7 each. Let me do that multiplication. 5 times 7 is 35. So, the shorts cost $35 total.\n\nThen she bought 2 pairs of shoes for $10 each. Let me calculate that. 2 times 10 is 20. So the shoes cost $20 total.\n\nSo, shorts and shoes together cost $35 + $20. Let me add those. 35 plus 20 is 55. So, that's $55 for the shorts and shoes.\n\nNow, she also bought 4 tops, all at the same price. Let me call the price of each top \"x\". So, the total cost for the tops would be 4 times x, which is 4x.\n\nSo, the total amount she spent is the sum of the shorts, shoes, and tops. That should equal $75. So, the equation would be:\n\nShorts + Shoes + Tops = Total\n\nWhich is:\n\n$35 + $20 + 4x = $75\n\nLet me write that out numerically:\n\n35 + 20 + 4x = 75\n\nAdding 35 and 20 gives me 55, so:\n\n55 + 4x = 75\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. To do that, I can subtract 55 from both sides of the equation. Let me do that.\n\n55 + 4x - 55 = 75 - 55\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\n4x = 20\n\nNow, to find x, I divide both sides by 4.\n\n4x / 4 = 20 / 4\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx = 5\n\nSo, each top costs $5. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nIf each top is $5, then 4 tops would be 4 * 5 = $20. Then, adding the shorts ($35) and shoes ($20), that's 35 + 20 + 20 = 75. Yes, that adds up to the total amount she spent. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nTotal spent: $75.\n\nShorts: 5 * 7 = 35. Correct.\n\nShoes: 2 * 10 = 20. Correct.\n\nTotal for shorts and shoes: 35 + 20 = 55. Correct.\n\nTotal for tops: 75 - 55 = 20. Then 20 divided by 4 tops is 5. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo each top is $5. I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure there's no trick or anything in the question. The problem says she bought 5 pairs of shorts for $7 each, so that's 5 items at $7 each. Then 2 pairs of shoes for $10 each, so 2 items at $10 each. Then 4 tops, all same price. So, yeah, the math checks out. So the answer is $5 per top.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe cost of each top is \\boxed{5}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the cost of each top, we begin by analyzing the total amount Ann spent and breaking it down into the individual components of her purchase.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the shorts\nAnn bought **5 pairs of shorts** at **$7 each**:\n\n$$\n5 \\times 7 = 35\n$$\n\nSo, the shorts cost **$35**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the shoes\nShe also bought **2 pairs of shoes** at **$10 each**:\n\n$$\n2 \\times 10 = 20\n$$\n\nSo, the shoes cost **$20**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Add the cost of shorts and shoes\n$$\n35 + 20 = 55\n$$\n\nSo, the combined cost of the shorts and shoes is **$55**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Determine the cost of the tops\nAnn spent a total of **$75**. Subtracting the cost of the shorts and shoes from the total gives the amount spent on the tops:\n\n$$\n75 - 55 = 20\n$$\n\nSo, the tops cost **$20** in total.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Find the cost per top\nAnn bought **4 tops**, all at the same price.

She does her shopping only at a specific store where she is allowed a credit of $100, which must be paid in full before her next shopping trip. That week she spent the full credit limit and paid $15 of it on Tuesday and $23 of it on Thursday. How much credit will Mary need to pay before her next shopping trip?", "gold_answer": "62", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, Mary has a credit limit of $100 at her specific store. She spent the full credit limit during the week. Then, she paid part of it on Tuesday and part on Thursday. The question is asking how much credit she needs to pay before her next shopping trip. \n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Mary is allowed a credit of $100, which means she can spend up to $100, but she has to pay it all back before she can go shopping again. So, if she spends the full $100, she has to pay that back in full before her next trip. But she didn't pay it all at once; she paid $15 on Tuesday and $23 on Thursday. So, the question is, how much does she still owe, and therefore, how much credit she needs to pay before her next trip?\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about this step by step. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, she starts with a credit limit of $100. She spends the full credit limit. So, she has spent $100. Then, she pays back some of it. On Tuesday, she pays $15, and on Thursday, she pays $23. So, the total amount she has paid so far is $15 + $23. Let me calculate that. 15 plus 23 is 38. So, she has paid $38 so far. \n\nTherefore, the remaining amount she owes would be the total spent minus the amount paid. That would be $100 - $38. Let me do that subtraction. 100 minus 38 is 62. So, she still owes $62. Therefore, before her next shopping trip, she needs to pay the remaining $62 to settle her credit. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's something I'm missing here. The problem says she is allowed a credit of $100, which must be paid in full before her next shopping trip. So, does that mean that she can't go shopping again until she pays the entire $100? But she already spent the full credit limit. So, she has to pay back the entire $100 before she can go again. However, she has only paid $38 so far. Therefore, she needs to pay the remaining $62. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased differently. Maybe the credit is $100, and she spent the full credit limit, meaning she spent $100. Then, she paid $15 and $23. So, the total she has paid is $38, so she still needs to pay $62. Therefore, the answer is $62. \n\nBut let me think again. Is there a possibility that the credit is not just the amount she spent? Wait, the problem says she is allowed a credit of $100, which must be paid in full before her next shopping trip. So, maybe the $100 is the total credit she can use. So, if she spends the full credit limit, that means she used up the entire $100. Then, she has to pay back that $100 before she can go again. But she has already paid $15 and $23. So, the total she has paid is $38, so she still needs to pay $62. Therefore, the answer is $62. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick me? Let me check again. \n\nOriginal credit limit: $100. She spent the full credit limit. So, she spent $100. Then, she paid $15 on Tuesday and $23 on Thursday. So, total paid is 15 + 23 = 38. Therefore, remaining balance is 100 - 38 = 62. Therefore, she needs to pay $62 before her next trip. \n\nYes, that seems straightforward. Maybe the answer is $62. \n\nBut let me check if there's another way to interpret the problem. For example, maybe the credit is $100, and she spent some amount, but the problem says she spent the full credit limit. So, she spent $100. Then, she paid $15 and $23. So, the total she has paid is $38. Therefore, the remaining is $62. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about how much credit she needs to pay, meaning the total amount she needs to pay before her next trip. Since she has to pay the entire $100, but she has already paid $38, so she needs to pay the remaining $62. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the store allows her to have a credit limit, and she can only spend up to that limit. But if she spends the full credit limit, then she has to pay it back. So, if she has paid part of it, she still needs to pay the rest. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is $62. \n\nBut let me check again. Maybe the problem is in the wording. \"She does her shopping only at a specific store where she is allowed a credit of $100, which must be paid in full before her next shopping trip.\" So, the credit is $100, which must be paid in full before next trip. So, if she spends the full credit limit, that means she has to pay back the $100. But she has already paid $15 and $23. Therefore, she needs to pay the remaining $62. \n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is $62. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that she is allowed a credit of $100, but she spent the full credit limit, meaning she spent $100. Then, she paid $15 and $23. So, the total she has paid is $38, so the remaining is $62. Therefore, she needs to pay $62 before her next trip. \n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, I think the answer is $62. \n\nI don't see any other way to interpret this. Maybe the problem is trying to trick me into thinking that she has to pay the entire $100, but since she already paid part of it, the remaining is $62. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about how much credit she needs to have available? But no, the question says \"how much credit will Mary need to pay before her next shopping trip?\" So, it's the amount she needs to pay, which is the remaining balance. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is $62. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{62}\n</think>\n\nMary is allowed a credit limit of $100 at the store, and she must pay the full amount before her next shopping trip.

He loads up the machine with 175 tennis balls to start with. Out of the first 100 balls, he manages to hit 2/5 of them. Of the next 75 tennis balls, he manages to hit 1/3 of them. Out of all the tennis balls, how many did Ralph not hit?", "gold_answer": "110", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Ralph has a tennis ball machine with 175 tennis balls. He starts hitting them, and we need to figure out how many he didn't hit. The problem says that out of the first 100 balls, he hit 2/5 of them. Then, out of the next 75 balls, he hit 1/3 of them. So, we need to calculate how many he hit in each group and then subtract that from the total to find out how many he didn't hit. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me confirm the total number of tennis balls. The problem says he starts with 175. Then, he uses the first 100 and the next 75. Wait, 100 plus 75 is 175. So, that adds up to all the balls he has. So, there's no leftover balls beyond those 175. So, the total number of balls he hit plus the number he didn't hit should equal 175.\n\nBut let me check again. The problem says he loads up the machine with 175 tennis balls. Then, out of the first 100, he hit 2/5. Then, of the next 75, he hit 1/3. So, the first 100 and the next 75 make up all 175. So, yes, that's correct. So, we can calculate the number of balls he hit in each group and then add them together, then subtract from 175 to get the number he didn't hit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can calculate the number he didn't hit in each group and add those together. Either way should work. Let me try both ways to check.\n\nFirst way: total hit = hit in first 100 + hit in next 75. Then total not hit = total - total hit.\n\nSecond way: not hit in first 100 + not hit in next 75.\n\nEither way, let's do the first way.\n\nFirst, calculate how many he hit in the first 100. It says he hit 2/5 of them. So, 2/5 of 100. Let me compute that. 2/5 times 100. Well, 1/5 of 100 is 20, so 2/5 is 40. So, he hit 40 balls in the first 100.\n\nThen, for the next 75 balls, he hit 1/3 of them. So, 1/3 of 75. Let me calculate that. 75 divided by 3 is 25. So, he hit 25 balls in the next 75.\n\nTherefore, total hit is 40 + 25 = 65. Therefore, total not hit is 175 - 65 = 110. So, the answer is 110?\n\nWait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me verify each step.\n\nFirst group: 100 balls. 2/5 hit. 2/5 of 100 is indeed 40. That seems right. 100 divided by 5 is 20, times 2 is 40. Correct.\n\nSecond group: 75 balls. 1/3 hit. 75 divided by 3 is 25. Correct. So, 25 hit. So total hit is 40 + 25 = 65. Total balls is 175. Therefore, 175 - 65 = 110. So, 110 balls not hit. That seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, let me calculate the number not hit in each group and add them. For the first group, he didn't hit 1 - 2/5 = 3/5. So, 3/5 of 100 is 60. For the second group, he didn't hit 1 - 1/3 = 2/3. So, 2/3 of 75. Let me compute that. 75 divided by 3 is 25, times 2 is 50. So, 50 not hit. Then total not hit is 60 + 50 = 110. Same answer. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 110. So, Ralph did not hit 110 tennis balls.\n\nBut let me check once more to be sure. Maybe I miscalculated something. Let me recheck the fractions.\n\nFirst group: 100 balls. 2/5 hit. 2/5 * 100 = 40. Correct. So, not hit is 100 - 40 = 60. Correct.\n\nSecond group: 75 balls. 1/3 hit. 1/3 * 75 = 25. So, not hit is 75 - 25 = 50. Correct. Then total not hit is 60 + 50 = 110. Correct. So, that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick me? Let me check the problem again.\n\n\"Ralph is going to practice playing tennis with a tennis ball machine that shoots out tennis balls for Ralph to hit. He loads up the machine with 175 tennis balls to start with. Out of the first 100 balls, he manages to hit 2/5 of them. Of the next 75 tennis balls, he manages to hit 1/3 of them. Out of all the tennis balls, how many did Ralph not hit?\"\n\nSo, the first 100, then next 75. So, 100 + 75 = 175. So, all the balls. So, yes, the total not hit is 110. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a trick where the next 75 is after the first 100, but maybe there's some overlap? But no, the problem says he loads up the machine with 175. Then, he uses the first 100, then the next 75. So, that's all 175. So, no overlap. So, the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the interpretation of \"out of the first 100 balls, he manages to hit 2/5 of them.\" So, 2/5 of the first 100. Which is 40. Then, of the next 75, 1/3 of them. Which is 25. So, total hit is 65. Total not hit is 175 - 65 = 110. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the wording? Let me check again.\n\n\"Out of the first 100 balls, he manages to hit 2/5 of them.\" So, 2/5 of the first 100. So, 2/5 * 100 = 40. Correct.\n\n\"Of the next 75 tennis balls, he manages to hit 1/3 of them.\" So, 1/3 of 75 is 25. Correct.\n\nSo, total hit is 40 + 25 = 65. Total not hit is 175 - 65 = 110. So, answer is 110.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the total number of balls? Let me check again. He loads up the machine with 175. Then, first 100, then next 75. 100 + 75 = 175. So, that's all the balls. So, no problem here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me into thinking that the next 75 is after the first 100, but maybe there's some other balls? But the problem says he loads up the machine with 175. So, he uses all of them. So, no, that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if 2/5 of 100 is indeed 40. Let me compute 2/5 of 100. 100 divided by 5 is 20. 20 times 2 is 40. Correct. 1/3 of 75 is 25. Correct. So, 40 + 25 is 65. 175 - 65 is 110. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 110. So, Ralph did not hit 110 tennis balls.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{110}\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many tennis balls Ralph did **not** hit, we begin by analyzing the information provided:\n\n- Ralph starts with **175 tennis balls**.\n- He hits **2/5 of the first 100 balls**.\n- He hits **1/3 of the next 75 balls**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the number of balls hit in each group\n\n**First 100 balls:**\n\nHe hits $ \\frac{2}{5} $ of them:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2}{5}", "final_answer": "110", "num_tokens": 2048, "num_reasoning_steps": 41, "activations_path": "results_thinking/embeddings/q_0025_4b_activations.npz"}

He collects 2 liters of seawater in an old bucket. If the water is 20% salt, how many ml of salt will Jack get when all the water evaporates?", "gold_answer": "400", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Jack has 2 liters of seawater, and it's 20% salt. He wants to find out how many milliliters of salt he'll get after all the water evaporates. Hmm, so first, I need to figure out how much salt is in those 2 liters of seawater. \n\nWait, percentages can sometimes be tricky. So if the water is 20% salt, that means 20% of the total volume is salt, right? But wait, is that correct? Or is it 20% by mass? Hmm, the problem says \"20% salt,\" but it doesn't specify. But since we're dealing with volume here, maybe it's 20% by volume? But seawater is mostly water, and salt is dissolved in it. So actually, salt concentration is usually expressed as a percentage by mass, but maybe in this problem, they are simplifying it to volume? Hmm, but the question is asking for milliliters of salt. So if it's 20% by volume, then maybe we can just calculate 20% of 2 liters. But wait, salt is a solid, so when you have a solution, the volume of the solution isn't exactly the sum of the volumes of the solute and solvent. But maybe in this problem, they are assuming that the salt concentration is 20% by volume? Or maybe they are assuming that the percentage is by mass? \n\nWait, the problem says \"the water is 20% salt.\" So maybe that's 20% by mass? But how do we convert that to volume? Because salt has a different density than water. Hmm, this is getting complicated. But maybe the problem is simplifying things, assuming that the percentage is by volume? Or maybe they just want us to take 20% of the total volume, regardless of the actual density? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using \"20% salt\" to mean that 20% of the mass is salt. But since the question is asking for milliliters of salt, we need to convert mass to volume. But we don't have the density of salt. Wait, but maybe they are assuming that the salt is in a way that when the water evaporates, the salt remains, and the volume of the salt is just 20% of the original volume? But that seems incorrect because salt is a solid, and when you have a solution, the volume of the solute isn't necessarily the same as the percentage. \n\nBut maybe this is a problem that is intended to be solved with simple percentage calculations, without considering the density. Maybe they just want 20% of 2 liters. Let me check. \n\nSo 2 liters is 2000 milliliters. If 20% of that is salt, then 20% of 2000 ml is 0.2 * 2000 = 400 ml. So would the answer be 400 ml? But that seems too straightforward. However, in reality, salt concentration in seawater is about 3.5% by mass, not 20%. But maybe this is a hypothetical problem where they say 20% salt. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using \"20% salt\" as a mass percentage. So if we have 2 liters of seawater, which is 2000 grams of water? Wait, no. Wait, 1 liter of water is 1000 grams, so 2 liters would be 2000 grams. But if the seawater is 20% salt by mass, then the mass of salt would be 20% of 2000 grams, which is 400 grams. Then, to convert that to volume, we need to know the density of salt. \n\nSalt (sodium chloride) has a density of about 2.16 g/cm\u00b3, which is 2160 kg/m\u00b3 or 2.16 g/mL. So if we have 400 grams of salt, then the volume would be mass divided by density. So 400 grams divided by 2.16 g/mL equals approximately 185.185... mL. So about 185 mL. \n\nBut the problem didn't mention anything about density. So maybe they are assuming that the salt is 20% by volume? Which would make the answer 400 mL. But that's not realistic. However, since the problem is probably intended for a math class rather than a chemistry class, maybe they just want the simple percentage of the volume. \n\nBut the problem says \"how many ml of salt will Jack get when all the water evaporates?\" So when the water evaporates, the salt remains. So the amount of salt is the same as the mass of salt in the original seawater. But if the problem says 20% salt, but doesn't specify by mass or volume, it's ambiguous. However, in common terms, when people say \"salt concentration\" in seawater, it's usually by mass. But again, without knowing the density, we can't convert mass to volume. \n\nBut maybe the problem is assuming that the 20% is by volume? So if you have 2 liters of seawater, 20% of that is salt, so 0.2 * 2000 ml = 400 ml. So that would be the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using \"20% salt\" as a mass percentage, but since the question is asking for volume, they expect you to use the density of salt. But since they didn't give the density, maybe they expect you to assume that 1 ml of salt is 1 gram? Which is not true, but maybe for the sake of the problem. \n\nWait, if we assume that the salt is 20% by mass, and that 1 ml of salt is 1 gram, then 20% of 2000 grams is 400 grams, which would be 400 ml. But in reality, salt is denser than water, so 400 grams would be less than 400 ml. But again, maybe the problem is simplifying. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using \"20% salt\" as a volume percentage, which is not accurate in real life, but for the sake of the problem, we can take it as such. \n\nSince the problem is presented in a math context, not a chemistry context, it's likely that they expect the simple percentage calculation. So 2 liters is 2000 ml. 20% of that is 400 ml. Therefore, the answer is 400 ml. \n\nBut I need to check if there's another way. Let me think again. \n\nIf the seawater is 20% salt by mass, then the mass of salt is 20% of the mass of the seawater. But the mass of seawater is 2 liters. Wait, but 2 liters of seawater is not 2000 grams. Because seawater is more dense than fresh water. Wait, the density of seawater is about 1.025 g/cm\u00b3, so 2 liters would be 2000 cm\u00b3 * 1.025 g/cm\u00b3 = 2050 grams. So if it's 20% salt by mass, then the mass of salt is 0.2 * 2050 grams = 410 grams. Then, converting that to volume, using the density of salt. \n\nBut again, the problem didn't give us the density of seawater or salt. So maybe they are assuming that the seawater is 20% salt by volume? Which would be 400 ml. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using \"20% salt\" as a mass percentage, and assuming that the density of seawater is 1 g/cm\u00b3, so 2 liters is 2000 grams. Then 20% of that is 400 grams of salt. Then, if we assume that the density of salt is 2.16 g/cm\u00b3, then 400 grams / 2.16 g/cm\u00b3 \u2248 185.185 cm\u00b3, which is 185.185 ml. But since the problem didn't give any density information, this is probably not the way to go. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the salt is 20% by volume, so 400 ml. \n\nBut given that the problem is presented in a math context, and not a chemistry context, it's more likely that they expect the simple percentage of the volume. Therefore, the answer is 400 ml. \n\nBut to be thorough, let me check if there's another approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the concentration of salt in seawater as 20% by mass, and they expect you to use the density of seawater to find the mass, then find the mass of salt, then convert that to volume. But since they didn't give the density of seawater or salt, that seems impossible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using \"20% salt\" as a volume percentage, so 20% of the volume is salt. Therefore, 2 liters * 0.2 = 0.4 liters = 400 ml. \n\nSince the problem is probably intended for a math class, and not a chemistry class, they are likely expecting the", "final_answer": null, "num_tokens": 2048, "num_reasoning_steps": 25, "activations_path": "results_thinking/embeddings/q_0026_4b_activations.npz"}

After downloading 800 files, he deleted 70% of them because they were not helpful. He downloaded 400 more files but again realized that 3/5 of them were irrelevant. How many valuable files was he left with after deleting the unrelated files he downloaded in the second round?", "gold_answer": "400", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, Brennan downloaded some files, then deleted some, then downloaded more, deleted more, and we need to find out how many valuable files he has left after all that. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, he downloaded 800 files. Then he deleted 70% of them because they were not helpful. So, I need to calculate how many files he deleted and how many remained after the first round.\n\nHmm, 70% of 800. Let me compute that. 70% is the same as 0.7 in decimal. So 0.7 multiplied by 800. Let me do that: 0.7 * 800. Well, 0.7 * 800 is 560. So he deleted 560 files. Therefore, the number of valuable files left after the first deletion would be the total downloaded minus the deleted. That is 800 - 560. Let me calculate that: 800 - 560 equals 240. So after the first round, he has 240 valuable files.\n\nNow, he downloaded 400 more files. So, adding that to his current count? Wait, no. Wait, he downloaded 400 more files, but then he deleted some of them. So first, he downloads 400, then deletes 3/5 of them. So we need to figure out how many he deleted and how many remained.\n\nSo, 3/5 of 400. Let me compute that. 3/5 is 0.6. So 0.6 * 400. Let me do that: 0.6 * 400. Well, 0.6 * 400 is 240. So he deleted 240 files in the second round. Therefore, the number of valuable files from the second download is 400 - 240 = 160.\n\nBut wait, does this 160 get added to the previous 240? Because he had 240 from the first round, then downloaded 400, which after deleting 240, leaves 160. So total valuable files would be 240 + 160 = 400? Is that right?\n\nWait, let me check again. First, he had 800 files, deleted 70%, so 560 deleted, 240 left. Then he downloads 400 more. So total files before deleting in the second round would be 240 + 400 = 640? Wait, no. Wait, does he delete the 400 files he downloaded, or does he keep the 240 and then download 400? The problem says he deleted 70% of the first 800, then downloaded 400 more, then deleted 3/5 of them. So the 240 is from the first round, and then he downloads 400, which are separate. Then he deletes 3/5 of those 400. So the 240 remains, and then from the second download, after deleting, he has 160. Therefore, total is 240 + 160 = 400. So the answer is 400?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me go step by step.\n\nFirst round:\n\nDownloaded: 800 files.\n\nDeleted 70%: 0.7 * 800 = 560 deleted. So remaining is 800 - 560 = 240. So that's correct.\n\nSecond round:\n\nDownloaded 400 more files. So now, he has 240 (from first round) + 400 (newly downloaded) = 640 files? Wait, but does he delete the 400 or does he delete some of them? The problem says he \"again realized that 3/5 of them were irrelevant.\" The \"them\" refers to the 400 he downloaded in the second round. So he deleted 3/5 of the 400, which is 240, so he kept 160. Therefore, the total valuable files would be the 240 from the first round plus the 160 from the second round, which is 240 + 160 = 400. So that seems correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's another interpretation. Maybe he deleted 3/5 of all files after the second download? But no, the problem says \"again realized that 3/5 of them were irrelevant.\" The \"them\" refers to the 400 he downloaded in the second round. So it's 3/5 of the 400. So that's 240 deleted, 160 kept. So total is 240 + 160 = 400. Therefore, the answer is 400. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that after deleting the first 70%, he had 240, then he downloaded 400, so total files before deleting is 240 + 400 = 640. Then he deletes 3/5 of them? But that would be different. But the problem says \"again realized that 3/5 of them were irrelevant.\" The \"them\" refers to the 400 he downloaded in the second round. So it's not 3/5 of all files, but 3/5 of the 400. Therefore, the answer is 400. But let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the wording. Let me read again:\n\n\"After downloading 800 files, he deleted 70% of them because they were not helpful. He downloaded 400 more files but again realized that 3/5 of them were irrelevant. How many valuable files was he left with after deleting the unrelated files he downloaded in the second round?\"\n\nSo, the key is \"after deleting the unrelated files he downloaded in the second round.\" So, the question is asking for the total number of valuable files after deleting the second round's irrelevant files. So, the first round's remaining files (240) plus the second round's remaining files (160). Therefore, 240 + 160 = 400. So the answer is 400. Therefore, \\boxed{400}?\n\nBut let me check once more. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate:\n\nFirst round:\n\n800 files. 70% deleted. 70% of 800 is 560. 800 - 560 = 240. Correct.\n\nSecond round:\n\nDownloaded 400. 3/5 of them are irrelevant. 3/5 of 400 is (3/5)*400 = 240. So 400 - 240 = 160. So 160 valuable files from the second round. Then total is 240 + 160 = 400. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that after the second round of deleting, he is left with the 240 plus the 160, so 400. Therefore, the answer is 400. I think that's correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way. Suppose someone might think that after deleting 70% of the first 800, he has 240. Then he downloads 400 more, so total files is 240 + 400 = 640. Then he deletes 3/5 of them. But that would be 3/5 of 640, which is 384. Then 640 - 384 = 256. But that would be wrong because the problem says \"3/5 of them were irrelevant\" where \"them\" refers to the 400 he downloaded in the second round, not the total files. So that interpretation is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 400. So I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{400}\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many valuable files Brennan was left with after deleting the irrelevant ones in both rounds, we need to carefully analyze the sequence of events and apply the given percentages step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **First Round:**\n\n- **Downloaded:** 800 files  \n- **Deleted:** 70% of 800  \n  $$\n  0.7 \\times 800 = 560 \\text{ files deleted}\n  $$\n- **Remaining valuable files:**  \n  $$\n  800 - 560 = 240 \\text{ files}\n  $$\n\n---\n\n### **Second Round:**\n\n- **Downloaded:** 400 more files  \n- **Irrelevant files:** 3/5 of 400  \n  $$\n  \\frac{3}{5} \\times 400 = 240 \\text{ files deleted}\n  $", "final_answer": "400", "num_tokens": 2048, "num_reasoning_steps": 39, "activations_path": "results_thinking/embeddings/q_0027_4b_activations.npz"}

If there are a total of 20 gnomes on the street, how many gnomes does the fifth house have?", "gold_answer": "8", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. There are 5 houses on a street. The first four houses each have 3 gnomes in their gardens. The total number of gnomes on the street is 20. I need to find out how many gnomes the fifth house has. \n\nFirst, I should figure out how many gnomes are in the first four houses. Since each of them has 3 gnomes, I can multiply the number of houses by the number of gnomes per house. So that would be 4 houses times 3 gnomes each. Let me calculate that: 4 * 3 equals 12. So the first four houses have 12 gnomes in total.\n\nNow, the total number of gnomes on the entire street is 20. That means the fifth house must have the remaining gnomes. To find that, I subtract the number of gnomes in the first four houses from the total. So that's 20 total gnomes minus 12 gnomes from the first four houses. Let me do the subtraction: 20 - 12 equals 8. \n\nWait, so does that mean the fifth house has 8 gnomes? Let me check my math again to be sure. First four houses: 4 * 3 = 12. Total is 20. 20 - 12 = 8. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nBut let me think again. Maybe I misread the problem? It says each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes. So that's definitely 4*3=12. Total is 20, so fifth house is 20-12=8. Hmm. That seems straightforward. \n\nIs there any chance that the fifth house could have a different number? Like maybe the problem is trying to trick me? For example, maybe the fifth house is included in the total? But no, the problem says \"each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes,\" and then the total is 20. So the fifth house is separate. So yeah, 20 total, subtract the first four, which is 12, so 8. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the wording? Let me check again. \"Each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes in the garden.\" So that's four houses with 3 each. Then the fifth house has some number. Total is 20. So 4*3 + x = 20, where x is the number of gnomes in the fifth house. Solving for x: x = 20 - 12 = 8. \n\nI think that's correct. Maybe I can think of it another way. If all five houses had 3 gnomes each, that would be 5*3=15. But the total is 20, which is 5 more than 15. So that extra 5 must be in the fifth house? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, if all five houses had 3, that's 15. But the total is 20, so there's 5 more gnomes. But that would mean that the fifth house has 3 + 5 = 8? Wait, that seems conflicting with the previous calculation. Wait, no, that approach is wrong. Because the first four houses already have 3 each. So if you think of the fifth house as having 3 plus the extra, but actually, the total is 20. Let me try again. \n\nIf the first four houses have 3 each, that's 12. Then the fifth house has x. So 12 + x = 20. Therefore, x = 8. So that's correct. The other approach where I thought of all five houses as 3 each is not applicable because the first four are already fixed at 3, and the fifth is variable. So that approach was wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the translation? The original problem says \"each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes in the garden.\" So that's four houses with 3 each. Then the fifth house has some number. Total is 20. So 4*3 + x = 20. So x=8. \n\nI think that's right. Maybe I can check with actual numbers. Let's say the first four houses have 3 each: 3, 3, 3, 3. That's 12. Then the fifth house has 8. Total is 12 + 8 = 20. Yep, that adds up. \n\nAlternatively, if the fifth house had, say, 7, then total would be 19. If it had 9, total would be 21. So 8 is the only number that makes it 20. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 8. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe fifth house has \\boxed{8} gnomes.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many gnomes the fifth house has, we start by analyzing the information provided:\n\n- There are **5 houses** on the street.\n- The **first four houses** each have **3 gnomes** in their gardens.\n- The **total number of gnomes** on the street is **20**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the total number of gnomes in the first four houses\n\nEach of the first four houses has 3 gnomes:\n\n$$\n4 \\text{ houses} \\times 3 \\text{ gnomes per house} = 12 \\text{ gnomes}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Determine how many gnomes are in the fifth house\n\nWe know the total number of gnomes on the street is 20.

Because otherwise, if her salary increased, and she still pays the same rent and utilities, then the percentage would decrease. So that must be the case. So the actual dollar amount for rent and utilities is the same before and after the raise. \n\nSo that means 0.4x = 0.25(x + 600). Is that correct? Let me check. Yes, because the amount she pays for rent and utilities is the same, just that the percentage of her income changes because her income increased. \n\nSo, solving this equation should give me the value of x, which is her previous monthly income. Let me write that equation again:\n\n0.4x = 0.25(x + 600)\n\nOkay, let's solve for x. First, maybe I can multiply both sides by 100 to eliminate the decimals. That would make it 40x = 25(x + 600). Let me check that. Yes, multiplying both sides by 100 gives 40x = 25(x + 600). \n\nAlternatively, I could also do it without multiplying by 100. Let me try both ways. \n\nFirst way: 0.4x = 0.25x + 0.25*600. Let me compute 0.25*600. That's 150. So:\n\n0.4x = 0.25x + 150\n\nSubtract 0.25x from both sides:\n\n0.4x - 0.25x = 150\n\nWhich is 0.15x = 150\n\nThen, x = 150 / 0.15\n\nCalculating that... 150 divided by 0.15. Well, 0.15 times 1000 is 150, so x = 1000? Wait, 0.15 times 1000 is 150. So yes, x is 1000. \n\nWait, so her previous monthly income was $1000? Let me check that. \n\nIf her previous income was $1000, then rent and utilities were 40% of that, which is 0.4*1000 = $400. \n\nAfter the raise, her income is 1000 + 600 = $1600. Then 25% of 1600 is 0.25*1600 = $400. \n\nYes, that matches. So the amount she pays for rent and utilities is the same, $400, before and after. So that seems to check out. \n\nAlternatively, if I do the other method where I multiply both sides by 100:\n\nOriginal equation: 0.4x = 0.25(x + 600)\n\nMultiply both sides by 100:\n\n40x = 25(x + 600)\n\nThen, 40x = 25x + 15000\n\nSubtract 25x:\n\n15x = 15000\n\nDivide by 15:\n\nx = 15000 / 15 = 1000. \n\nSame answer. So that seems correct. \n\nTherefore, her previous monthly income was $1000. \n\nBut let me just think again if there's another way this could be interpreted. For example, maybe the problem is saying that after the raise, her rent and utilities are 25% of her new income, but maybe the rent and utilities increased? But the problem says \"her rent and utilities only amount to 25% of her monthly income.\" The wording suggests that the amount she spends on rent and utilities is the same as before, but now it's a smaller percentage because her income is higher. \n\nAlternatively, if the rent and utilities had increased, but that seems less likely. The problem says \"used to spend... now her rent and utilities only amount to...\" So it's more likely that the actual amount is the same, but the percentage is different. \n\nSo I think the answer is $1000. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me try plugging in numbers. If previous income was $1000, then after raise, $1600. 40% of 1000 is 400, 25% of 1600 is 400. So that works. \n\nAlternatively, if I thought that the rent and utilities had increased, but that would be a different problem. For example, if her rent and utilities increased by some amount, but the problem doesn't mention that. It just says her salary was increased, and now the rent and utilities are a smaller percentage. So the only way that makes sense is that the actual amount is the same. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is $1000. \n\n**Final Answer**\nMrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was \\boxed{1000}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income, we start by defining her original income as $ x $. \n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\n- **Before the raise**, Mrs. Snyder spent **40%** of her income on rent and utilities.  \n  So, the amount spent on rent and utilities was:  \n  $$\n  0.4x\n  $$\n\n- **After the raise**, her income increased by **$600**, so her new income is:  \n  $$\n  x + 600\n  $$\n\n- Now, the same amount spent on rent and utilities is **25%** of her new income.  \n  So, the amount spent on rent and utilities is also:  \n  $$\n  0.25(x + 600)\n  $$\n\nSince the **amount spent on rent and utilities** is the same before and after the raise, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:\n\n$$\n0.4x = 0.25(x + 600)\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Solve the Equation\n\nStart by expanding the right-hand side:\n\n$$\n0.4x = 0.25x + 150\n$$\n\nSubtract $ 0.25x $ from both sides:\n\n$$\n0.15x = 150\n$$\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.15:\n\n$$\nx = \\frac{150}{0.15} = 1000\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Solution\n\n- **Previous income**: $ x = 1000 $\n- **Rent and utilities before**: $ 0.4 \\times 1000 = 400 $\n- **New income after raise**: $ 1000 + 600 = 1600 $\n- **Rent and utilities after**: $ 0.25 \\times 1600 = 400 $\n\nThe amount spent on rent and utilities is the same in both cases, confirming the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{1000}\n$$", "final_answer": "1000", "num_tokens": 1830, "num_reasoning_steps": 64, "activations_path": "results_thinking/embeddings/q_0029_4b_activations.npz"}
