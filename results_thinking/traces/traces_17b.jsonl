In April, she sold 48 clips to her friends. Then in May, she sold half as many as she did in April. The question is asking how many clips she sold altogether in April and May.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many clips she sold in May. Since she sold half as many in May as she did in April, I should calculate half of 48. Let me do that. Half of 48 is 24. So, in May, she sold 24 clips.\n\nNow, to find the total number of clips sold in both months, I need to add the number from April and May. That would be 48 (April) plus 24 (May). Let me add those numbers. 48 plus 24... Hmm, 40 plus 20 is 60, and 8 plus 4 is 12, so 60 plus 12 is 72. So, the total number of clips sold is 72.\n\nWait, let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. April is 48, May is half of that, which is 24. 48 + 24 is indeed 72. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any errors here. So the answer should be 72 clips in total.\n</think>\n\nNatalia sold 48 clips in April.

How much did she earn?", "gold_answer": "10", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. But she only did 50 minutes yesterday. Hmm, so I need to figure out how much she earned for those 50 minutes. \n\nFirst, I know that earnings are usually calculated based on hours, right? So if she makes $12 per hour, then I need to convert 50 minutes into hours. Wait, how do I convert minutes to hours? Well, there are 60 minutes in an hour. So 50 minutes is... let me calculate that. \n\n50 divided by 60. Let me do that division. 50 divided by 60 is the same as 5/6, which is approximately 0.8333 hours. So she worked 5/6 of an hour. \n\nThen, her earnings would be her hourly rate multiplied by the number of hours she worked. So that's $12 times 5/6. Let me compute that. \n\n12 multiplied by 5 is 60. Then divided by 6. So 60 divided by 6 is 10. So she earned $10. \n\nWait, let me check that again. If 1 hour is $12, then 50 minutes is 5/6 of an hour. So 5/6 of $12. Let me do 12 divided by 6 first, which is 2. Then multiply by 5. 2 times 5 is 10. Yeah, that's the same result. So $10. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as how many dollars she gets per minute. Since she gets $12 per hour, that's $12 per 60 minutes. So per minute, it's $12 divided by 60. Which is $0.2 per minute. Then multiply by 50 minutes. \n\nSo 0.2 times 50 is 10. Yep, same answer. \n\nSo regardless of the method, it seems like she earned $10. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. \n\nAnother way: 50 minutes is 50/60 hours. 50 divided by 60 is 0.8333... hours. Multiply by $12: 0.8333 * 12. Let me compute that. 0.8333 * 12. Well, 0.8333 is 5/6. 5/6 of 12 is 10. Yep. \n\nSo all methods lead to $10. I think that's the right answer. \n\n**Final Answer**\nWeng earned \\boxed{10} dollars.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how much Weng earned yesterday, we start by analyzing the given information:\n\n- Weng earns **$12 per hour**.\n- She worked for **50 minutes**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Convert minutes to hours\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 50 minutes to hours:\n\n$$\n\\frac{50}{60} = \\frac{5}{6} \\text{ hours}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate earnings\n\nNow, multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours worked:\n\n$$\n12 \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{60}{6} = 10\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\nWeng earned:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{10}\n$$", "final_answer": "10", "num_tokens": 766, "num_reasoning_steps": 24, "activations_path": "results_thinking/embeddings/q_0001_17b_activations.npz"}

So first, I need to figure out how much she has right now. Half of $100 is $50. So she has $50 saved.\n\nThen, her parents are giving her $15. Let me add that to her savings. So $50 plus $15 would be... let me calculate that. 50 + 15 is 65. So now she has $65.\n\nNext, her grandparents are giving her twice as much as her parents. Her parents gave her $15, so twice that would be 2 times $15. Let me do that multiplication. 2 times 15 is 30. So the grandparents are giving her $30.\n\nNow, I need to add that $30 to her existing $65. So 65 + 30 is... 95. So now Betty has $95.\n\nThe wallet costs $100, so she needs $100 - $95. That should be $5 more. Wait, let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting over: Betty needs $100. She has half, which is $50. Parents give her $15, so $50 + $15 = $65. Grandparents give her twice the parents' amount, which is $30. So $65 + $30 = $95. Then $100 - $95 = $5. Yeah, that seems right. So Betty needs $5 more.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I interpreted \"twice as much as her parents\" correctly. The parents gave her $15, so twice that is indeed $30. So that's correct. So total money she has is $50 + $15 + $30 = $95. Therefore, she needs $5 more. So the answer should be $5.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe there's a different way to approach it. Let's see:\n\nTotal needed: $100.\n\nBetty has half, which is 50. Then parents give 15, grandparents give 30. So total given is 15 + 30 = 45. So total she has is 50 + 45 = 95. So 100 - 95 = 5. Yep, same result. So I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think that \"twice as much as her parents\" is twice the amount her parents gave, which is $15, so $30. So that's correct. So no issues there.\n\nSo the answer is $5. Therefore, Betty needs $5 more.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{5}\n</think>\n\nTo determine how much more money Betty needs to buy the wallet, we can break the problem into clear steps:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Determine how much Betty currently has\n\nBetty needs $100 for the wallet, and she has **half** of that amount:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 100 = 50\n$$\n\nSo, Betty currently has **$50**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Add the money given by her parents\n\nHer parents give her **$15** for the wallet.

Let me calculate that: 12 times 2 is 24. So today, she read 24 pages.\n\nNow, let's figure out how many pages she has left to read. The total pages are 120. She has already read 12 (yesterday) + 24 (today) = 36 pages. So, the remaining pages are 120 minus 36. Let me do that subtraction: 120 - 36. Hmm, 120 minus 30 is 90, then minus 6 more is 84.

How many pages does he write a year?", "gold_answer": "624", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week. I need to find out how many pages he writes a year. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many letters he writes in a week. He writes to 2 friends twice a week. So, 2 friends times 2 times a week. That would be 2 * 2 = 4 letters per week. Wait, is that right? Yeah, if he writes to each friend twice a week, then for each friend, it's 2 letters, so two friends would be 2 * 2 = 4 letters per week. Got that.\n\nNow, each letter is 3 pages. So, if he writes 4 letters each week, then the total pages per week would be 4 letters * 3 pages per letter. Let me calculate that: 4 * 3 = 12 pages per week. Okay, so 12 pages each week.\n\nNow, how many pages in a year? Well, a year has 52 weeks. So, if he writes 12 pages each week, then over 52 weeks, it would be 12 * 52. Let me compute that. 12 * 50 is 600, and 12 * 2 is 24, so 600 + 24 = 624. So, 624 pages a year?\n\nWait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me do 12 * 52. 12 * 50 is 600, and 12 * 2 is 24. Adding them together gives 624. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nBut let me verify each step once more to be sure. Starting with the number of letters per week: 2 friends * 2 times a week = 4 letters. Each letter is 3 pages, so 4 * 3 = 12 pages per week. Then, 52 weeks * 12 pages per week. 52 * 12. Let me do 52 * 10 = 520, and 52 * 2 = 104. Adding those gives 520 + 104 = 624. Yep, same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as 12 pages per week times 52 weeks. 12 * 52. Let me do 12 * 52. 12 * 50 is 600, 12 * 2 is 24, total 624. So, that's consistent.\n\nIs there another way to approach this? Maybe calculate the total pages per year directly. For example, 3 pages per letter, 2 friends, 2 times a week, 52 weeks.\n\nSo, pages per year = 3 pages/letter * 2 friends * 2 times/week * 52 weeks.\n\nCalculating that: 3 * 2 = 6 pages per friend per week. Then 6 * 2 = 12 pages per week. Then 12 * 52 = 624. Yep, same answer.\n\nSo, I think 624 pages is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step checks out. So, James writes 624 pages a year.\n\n**Final Answer**\nJames writes \\boxed{624} pages a year.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many pages James writes in a year, we can break the problem into smaller, manageable steps:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Determine the number of letters written per week\n\nJames writes to **2 different friends** **twice a week**.\n\n$$\n\\text{Letters per week} = 2 \\text{ friends} \\times 2 \\text{ times per week} = 4 \\text{ letters per week}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the total pages written per week\n\nEach letter is **3 pages** long.\n\n$$\n\\text{Pages per week} = 4 \\text{ letters} \\times 3 \\text{ pages per letter} = 12 \\text{ pages per week}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the total pages written in a year\n\nThere are **52 weeks in a year**.\n\n$$\n\\text{Pages per year} = 12 \\text{ pages per week} \\times 52 \\text{ weeks} = 624 \\text{ pages}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{624}\n$$", "final_answer": "624", "num_tokens": 1011, "num_reasoning_steps": 25, "activations_path": "results_thinking/embeddings/q_0004_17b_activations.npz"}

How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?", "gold_answer": "35", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how many flowers Mark has in his garden. So, the problem says he has three different colors: yellow, purple, and green. \n\nFirst, let me note down the given information:\n\n- There are 10 yellow flowers.\n- Purple flowers are 80% more than the yellow ones.\n- Green flowers are 25% as many as the yellow and purple flowers combined.\n- We need to find the total number of flowers.\n\nAlright, let's break it down step by step.\n\nStarting with the yellow flowers. The problem says there are 10 yellow flowers. That's straightforward.\n\nNext, the purple flowers. It says there are 80% more of those in purple than in yellow. Hmm, so \"80% more\" means that the number of purple flowers is the original number plus 80% of that original number. Let me write that as an equation.\n\nLet me denote the number of purple flowers as P. Then, according to the problem:\n\nP = yellow flowers + 80% of yellow flowers.\n\nWhich is:\n\nP = 10 + 0.8 * 10\n\nCalculating that:\n\n0.8 * 10 = 8\n\nSo, P = 10 + 8 = 18\n\nSo, there are 18 purple flowers.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If there are 10 yellow, and 80% more purple, that would be 10 + 8 = 18. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, moving on to the green flowers. The problem says there are 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. So, green flowers = 25% of (yellow + purple).\n\nLet me compute that. First, yellow + purple is 10 + 18 = 28.\n\nSo, green flowers = 25% of 28.\n\n25% is 0.25, so 0.25 * 28 = 7.\n\nTherefore, there are 7 green flowers.\n\nNow, to find the total number of flowers, we add up yellow, purple, and green.\n\nTotal = yellow + purple + green = 10 + 18 + 7.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n10 + 18 is 28, and 28 + 7 is 35.\n\nSo, total flowers are 35?\n\nWait, let me check again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with yellow: 10. Purple: 10 + 80% of 10 = 18. Green: 25% of (10 + 18) = 25% of 28 = 7. Total: 10 + 18 + 7 = 35. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me think again if I interpreted \"80% more\" correctly. Sometimes, people can misinterpret \"more\" in percentage terms. For example, if something is 80% more, does that mean 80% of the original, or 80% of the original plus the original?\n\nWait, the problem says \"there are 80% more of those in purple.\" So, \"more\" here refers to the additional amount. So, if there are 10 yellow, then purple is 10 + 80% of 10, which is 18. That's correct. So, 80% more than yellow is 18. So that's right.\n\nAnother check: 80% of 10 is 8, so 10 + 8 = 18. Yep.\n\nThen green is 25% of (yellow + purple). So, 25% of 28 is 7. So, 7 green. Then total is 10 + 18 + 7 = 35. \n\nWait, but let me check if the problem says \"25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers.\" So, green is 25% of (yellow + purple). So, that's 25% of 28, which is 7. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that green is 25% of yellow and 25% of purple, but the problem says \"as many as there are yellow and purple flowers,\" so it's 25% of the total of yellow and purple. So, that's 25% of 28, which is 7. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total flowers: 10 + 18 + 7 = 35. So, 35 flowers in total.\n\nBut let me check once more. Maybe I made a mistake in the percentage calculations.\n\nFor purple: 80% more than yellow. So, if yellow is 10, then 80% more is 10 + 0.8*10 = 18. Correct.\n\nGreen: 25% of (10 + 18) = 25% of 28. 25% is 0.25, so 0.25*28 = 7. Correct.\n\nTotal: 10 + 18 + 7 = 35. Yes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the interpretation of \"25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers.\" So, if green is 25% of (yellow + purple), then yes, that's 7. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that green is 25% of yellow and 25% of purple, but that would be different. But the problem says \"as many as there are yellow and purple flowers,\" so it's 25% of the total of yellow and purple. So, that's 25% of 28, which is 7. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of flowers is 35. So, the answer should be 35.\n\nBut let me check once more with another approach.\n\nLet me write all the numbers:\n\nYellow: 10\n\nPurple: 10 + 0.8*10 = 18\n\nGreen: 0.25*(10 + 18) = 0.25*28 = 7\n\nTotal: 10 + 18 + 7 = 35.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the percentage. Let me check if 80% more is 80% of the original, or 80% of the original plus the original. Which is correct.\n\nFor example, if something is 80% more, then it's original + 80% of original = 180% of original. So, yes, 80% more is 180% of the original. So, 10 * 1.8 = 18. Correct.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 35.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe total number of flowers in Mark's garden is \\boxed{35}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the total number of flowers in Mark's garden, we analyze the given information step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the given data\n\n- **Yellow flowers**: 10\n- **Purple flowers**: 80% more than yellow\n- **Green flowers**: 25% of the total number of yellow and purple flowers\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the number of purple flowers\n\nIf there are 10 yellow flowers, and purple flowers are 80% more than yellow, then:\n\n$$\n\\text{Purple flowers} = 10 + 0.8 \\times 10 = 10 + 8 = 18\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the number of green flowers\n\nGreen flowers are 25% of the total number of yellow and purple flowers:\n\n$$\n\\text{Green flowers} = 0.25 \\times (10 + 18) = 0.25 \\times 28 = 7\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the total number of flowers\n\n$$\n\\text{Total flowers} = \\text{Yellow} + \\text{Purple} + \\text{Green} = 10 + 18 + 7 = 35\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{35}\n$$", "final_answer": "35", "num_tokens": 1831, "num_reasoning_steps": 69, "activations_path": "results_thinking/embeddings/q_0005_17b_activations.npz"}

The problem says a large pizza has 16 slices and a small one has 8. So, for the large pizzas, he has 2 of them. Let me calculate that. \n\n2 large pizzas times 16 slices each. Let me do 2 times 16. 2 times 16 is 32. So that's 32 slices from the large pizzas. \n\nThen there are 2 small pizzas. Each small pizza has 8 slices. So 2 small pizzas times 8 slices each.

Ken placed a box on a scale, and then he poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.  Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple.  Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans.  And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again.  What was the final weight of the box of goodies, in pounds?", "gold_answer": "16", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the final weight of the box after all these additions. So, Ken started by putting jelly beans on the scale, which brought the weight to 2 pounds. Then he added brownies to make the weight triple. Then added another 2 pounds of jelly beans, and finally added gummy worms to double the weight again. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial weight is 2 pounds of jelly beans. Then he adds brownies. The problem says that adding brownies caused the weight to triple. So, if the initial weight was 2 pounds, tripling that would be 2 * 3 = 6 pounds. So after adding the brownies, the total weight is 6 pounds.\n\nNext, he adds another 2 pounds of jelly beans. So, we need to add 2 pounds to the current weight of 6 pounds. That would make 6 + 2 = 8 pounds. Now the weight is 8 pounds.\n\nThen, he adds enough gummy worms to double the weight once again. So, the current weight is 8 pounds. Doubling that would be 8 * 2 = 16 pounds. So, after adding the gummy worms, the total weight is 16 pounds.\n\nWait, let me check if I did that correctly. Let me go through each step again.\n\nStart: 2 pounds of jelly beans.\n\nAdd brownies to triple the weight. So 2 * 3 = 6. So after adding brownies, it's 6 pounds.\n\nThen add 2 pounds of jelly beans. So 6 + 2 = 8 pounds.\n\nThen add gummy worms to double the weight. So 8 * 2 = 16. So final weight is 16 pounds.\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. But let me make sure I didn't misinterpret any of the steps.\n\nThe problem says: \"poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.\" So that's the first step. Then \"added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple.\" So, after adding the jelly beans, the weight is 2 pounds. Then adding brownies makes it triple. So 2 * 3 = 6. Then adding another 2 pounds of jelly beans. So 6 + 2 = 8. Then adding gummy worms to double the weight. So 8 * 2 = 16. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to check if the \"triple\" is after adding the brownies. Let me parse the sentence again:\n\n\"Ken placed a box on a scale, and then he poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds. Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple. Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans. And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again.\"\n\nSo, the sequence is:\n\n1. Jelly beans: 2 pounds.\n\n2. Brownies: make the weight triple. So, after adding brownies, the weight is 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.\n\n3. Then add another 2 pounds of jelly beans. So, 6 + 2 = 8 pounds.\n\n4. Then add gummy worms to double the weight. So, 8 * 2 = 16 pounds.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the final weight is 16 pounds.\n\nBut let me think again. Sometimes, when problems say \"to cause the weight to triple,\" does that mean that the brownies are added to the existing weight, which was 2 pounds, so tripling it? So, 2 * 3 = 6. Then adding 2 pounds of jelly beans, so 6 + 2 = 8. Then doubling the weight, which is 8 * 2 = 16. Yep.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"triple\" is done in a different way? For example, if the brownies were added to the jelly beans, but the problem says \"added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple.\" So, the weight after adding brownies is triple the original weight. So original weight was 2 pounds, so after adding brownies, it's 6 pounds. Then adding 2 pounds of jelly beans, so 6 + 2 = 8. Then doubling the weight, which is 16. So yes, 16 pounds.\n\nI think that's correct. So the final answer is 16 pounds. Therefore, the box of goodies weighs 16 pounds.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe final weight of the box of goodies is \\boxed{16} pounds.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the final weight of the box of goodies, we will analyze the sequence of additions step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial Weight\nKen starts by placing **2 pounds** of jelly beans into the box.\n\n**Weight after jelly beans:**  \n$$\n2 \\text{ pounds}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Adding Brownies\nKen then adds enough brownies to **triple** the weight.

She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?", "gold_answer": "41", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Alexis went to a department store and bought some clothes for her job interview. She had a budget of $200. Let me try to figure out how much she spent on each item and then find out how much she paid for the shoes.\n\nFirst, the problem lists the amounts she spent on each item:\n\n- Button-up shirt: $30\n- Suit pants: $46\n- Suit coat: $38\n- Socks: $11\n- Belt: $18\n- Shoes: ? (This is what we need to find)\n\nShe also mentions she has $16 left from her budget. So, the total amount she spent on all these items plus the shoes should add up to her original budget of $200, minus the $16 she has left. Wait, actually, if she has $16 left, that means the total amount she spent is her budget minus $16. Let me confirm that.\n\nOriginal budget: $200\n\nAmount left: $16\n\nSo total spent = 200 - 16 = $184\n\nTherefore, the sum of all the items she bought (shirt, pants, coat, socks, belt, shoes) should be $184.\n\nLet me add up the amounts she already spent:\n\nShirt: $30\n\nPants: $46\n\nCoat: $38\n\nSocks: $11\n\nBelt: $18\n\nLet me add these step by step.\n\nFirst, 30 + 46. Let's see, 30 + 40 is 70, plus 6 is 76.\n\nThen, 76 + 38. 70 + 30 is 100, 6 + 8 is 14, so total 114.\n\nThen, 114 + 11. That's 125.\n\nThen, 125 + 18. 125 + 10 is 135, plus 8 is 143.\n\nSo, total spent on these items is $143. Then, the shoes would be the remaining amount.\n\nTotal spent is $184, so 184 - 143 = ?\n\nLet me calculate that. 184 - 140 is 44, then minus 3 more is 41. So, $41.\n\nWait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in adding.\n\nStarting over:\n\nShirt: $30\n\nPants: $46. 30 + 46 = 76.\n\nCoat: $38. 76 + 38. Let's do 76 + 30 = 106, then +8 = 114. Correct.\n\nSocks: $11. 114 + 11 = 125. Correct.\n\nBelt: $18. 125 + 18. 125 + 10 = 135, +8 = 143. Correct.\n\nSo total spent on these items is $143. Then, total budget is $200, and she has $16 left. So total spent is 200 - 16 = 184. Therefore, shoes cost 184 - 143 = 41.\n\nSo, the answer should be $41. Let me check once more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can add all the items including shoes and see if it equals 184.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nLet me denote the shoes as x.\n\nSo, 30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18 + x = 184\n\nAdding the known amounts:\n\n30 + 46 = 76\n\n76 + 38 = 114\n\n114 + 11 = 125\n\n125 + 18 = 143\n\nSo, 143 + x = 184\n\nTherefore, x = 184 - 143 = 41.\n\nYes, same result. So, the shoes cost $41.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she had a budget of $200, and she spent $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 + x = 200 - 16 = 184. So same equation.\n\nYes, so 30+46 is 76, 76+38 is 114, 114+11 is 125, 125+18 is 143, so 143 + x = 184. So x = 41.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $41.\n\n**Final Answer**\nAlexis paid \\boxed{41} dollars for the shoes.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how much Alexis paid for the shoes, we start by analyzing the total budget and the amount she has left.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Total Budget and Remaining Amount\n\nAlexis had a budget of **$200** and has **$16 left** after all purchases. Therefore, the total amount she spent on all items, including the shoes, is:\n\n$$\n200 - 16 = 184\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: List of Known Expenses\n\nFrom the problem, we know the following amounts:\n\n- Button-up shirt: $30  \n- Suit pants: $46  \n- Suit coat: $38  \n- Socks: $11  \n- Belt: $18  \n\nLet the cost of the shoes be $ x $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Add Known Expenses\n\nWe add up the known expenses:\n\n$$\n30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18 = 143\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Solve for the Cost of the Shoes\n\nNow, we know the total amount spent is $184, and we've already spent $143 on other items.

If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.  If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?", "gold_answer": "990", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Tina makes $18.00 an hour. She works more than 8 hours per shift, so she gets overtime. Overtime is paid at her hourly wage plus half her hourly wage. So, first, I need to figure out how much she gets paid for the regular hours and the overtime hours.\n\nShe works 10 hours every day for 5 days. So, total hours worked in a week would be 10 hours/day * 5 days = 50 hours. But wait, let me check that again. If she works 10 hours each day for 5 days, that's 10*5=50 hours total. But does that include the overtime? Hmm, the problem says she works more than 8 hours per shift. So, each shift is 10 hours. So, each day she works 10 hours, which is more than 8, so she gets overtime on those 10 hours.\n\nSo, first, let's calculate the regular pay and the overtime pay.\n\nRegular pay is for the first 8 hours, and then overtime is for the extra hours. Wait, but the problem says \"if she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.\" So, does that mean that for each hour over 8, she gets 1.5 times her hourly wage? So, for each hour over 8, she gets 1.5 times her regular rate?\n\nSo, for each shift of 10 hours, she works 8 regular hours and 2 overtime hours. So, the regular pay would be 8 hours * $18.00, and the overtime pay would be 2 hours * (1.5 * $18.00). Then, total pay per shift is regular + overtime.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"if she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.\" So, maybe the overtime rate is 1.5 times her hourly wage. So, for each hour over 8, she gets 1.5 times her hourly wage. So, for each shift of 10 hours, she gets 8 hours at 18, and 2 hours at 1.5*18.\n\nSo, let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, regular pay per shift: 8 * 18 = 144 dollars.\n\nOvertime pay per shift: 2 * (1.5 * 18) = 2 * 27 = 54 dollars.\n\nTotal pay per shift: 144 + 54 = 198 dollars.\n\nThen, she works 5 days, so total pay is 198 * 5 = 990 dollars.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Is the overtime rate applied per hour, so for each hour over 8, she gets 1.5 times her hourly wage. So, for 10 hours, she gets 8 regular hours and 2 overtime hours. So, yes, 8*18 + 2*1.5*18. Which is 144 + 54 = 198 per shift. Then 5 shifts would be 198*5=990.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to think about it. Maybe the total hours are 50 hours, and she gets overtime for the hours over 8. So, total hours worked is 50, so the regular hours are 8 hours per shift, but wait, no. Wait, the problem says she works 10 hours every day. So, each day she works 10 hours, which is more than 8, so she gets overtime on those 10 hours. So, per day, she works 10 hours, which is 8 regular and 2 overtime. So, per day, she gets 198 dollars. Then 5 days would be 990.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total hours are 50 hours, and the regular pay is for the first 8 hours, and then overtime for the rest. But wait, if she works 50 hours total, how many are regular and how many are overtime?\n\nWait, but the problem says that she works more than 8 hours per shift. So, each shift is 10 hours. So, each day she works 10 hours, which is more than 8. So, for each day, she gets 8 regular hours and 2 overtime hours. So, per day, 8*18 + 2*1.5*18 = 198. So, 5 days would be 5*198=990.\n\nAlternatively, if we think of total hours as 50 hours, then the regular hours would be 8 hours per day, but wait, no. Wait, the regular hours are 8 hours per shift, but she works 10 hours per day. So, the regular hours are 8 hours, and the overtime is 2 hours. So, per day, 8 regular hours and 2 overtime hours. So, total for 5 days: 5 days * 8 regular hours = 40 regular hours, and 5 days * 2 overtime hours = 10 overtime hours. Then, total regular pay is 40*18, total overtime pay is 10*1.5*18. Then total pay is 40*18 + 10*27 = 720 + 270 = 990. Same answer.\n\nSo, either way, 990 dollars.\n\nBut let me check again. Maybe the question is about total pay for 5 days, each day 10 hours. So, total hours is 50. So, regular hours are 8 hours per day, but for 5 days, that's 40 hours. Overtime hours are 10 hours. So, regular pay is 40*18, overtime is 10*1.5*18. So, 40*18 is 720, 10*27 is 270, total 990. Yep.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that the overtime is calculated per hour, so for each hour over 8, you get 1.5 times. So, for 50 hours, the regular hours are 8 hours per day, but how many total regular hours? Wait, no. Wait, if she works 10 hours each day, then the regular hours are 8 hours, and the overtime is 2 hours. So, for 5 days, 5*8=40 regular hours, and 5*2=10 overtime hours. So, same as before.\n\nSo, 40*18 + 10*27 = 720 + 270 = 990.\n\nSo, the answer is $990.\n\nBut let me check once more. Maybe the question is about the total pay for 5 days, each day 10 hours. So, 5 days * 10 hours = 50 hours. So, regular pay is 8 hours * 18, and overtime is 50 - 8*5 = 50 - 40 = 10 hours. So, 10 hours of overtime. So, 10*1.5*18 = 270. Regular pay is 40*18=720. Total 990. Yep.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. So, the answer is $990.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{990}\n</think>\n\nTo determine how much Tina makes in total for 5 days of work, we need to break down her pay into regular and overtime components.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Determine Total Hours Worked**\n\nTina works **10 hours per day** for **5 days**:\n\n$$\n\\text{Total hours} = 10 \\, \\text{hours/day} \\times 5 \\, \\text{days} = 50 \\, \\text{hours}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate Regular Pay**\n\nTina is paid **$18.00 per hour** for the first 8 hours of each shift.

So, there's this deep-sea monster that comes every hundred years to feast on a ship. Over three hundred years, it has eaten 847 people. Each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. We need to find out how many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years.\n\nFirst, let me parse the information. The monster comes every hundred years, so over three hundred years, it would have eaten three times? Wait, no. Wait, three hundred years is three hundred years. If it comes every hundred years, then in the first hundred years, it eats one ship, then the next hundred years, another ship, and then the next hundred years, another ship. So over three hundred years, there are three ships eaten? But the total number of people is 847. So maybe each ship has a certain number of people, and each subsequent ship has twice as many as the previous one. So if we let the first ship have x people, then the second ship would have 2x, and the third ship would have 4x. Then the total number of people would be x + 2x + 4x = 7x. And that equals 847? Wait, but the problem says over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people. So if there are three ships, each with x, 2x, 4x people, then total is 7x = 847? Then x would be 847 divided by 7. Let me check that.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Wait, maybe the ships are not three? Wait, the monster comes every hundred years. So in three hundred years, it would have eaten three ships? So first hundred years: ship 1, next hundred years: ship 2, next hundred years: ship 3. So three ships. So total people is x + 2x + 4x = 7x = 847. Then x is 847 / 7. Let me compute that. 7 times 120 is 840, so 847 - 840 is 7, so 120 + 1 = 121. So x is 121. Therefore, the first ship had 121 people. So the answer would be 121? But let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship.\" So the first ship, let's say, is the one in the first hundred years. Then the next ship, which is in the next hundred years, has twice as many people as the last ship. So if the first ship had x, the second has 2x, the third has 4x. So total is x + 2x + 4x = 7x. So 7x = 847. Therefore, x = 121. So the first ship had 121 people. Therefore, the answer is 121. But let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the monster comes every hundred years, so in three hundred years, it would have eaten three ships. But maybe the first ship is in the first hundred years, the second in the next hundred, and the third in the next hundred. So three ships. So total people is 7x = 847. So x = 121. So the first ship had 121 people. Therefore, the answer is 121. But let me check if there's another way to interpret the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the monster comes every hundred years, so in the first hundred years, it eats one ship, then in the next hundred years, another ship, and then in the next hundred years, another ship. So three ships. So total people is 847. So if each subsequent ship has twice as many people as the previous one, then the first ship is x, second is 2x, third is 4x. So total is x + 2x + 4x = 7x = 847. Therefore, x = 121. So the answer is 121. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut let me check if there's another interpretation. For example, maybe the monster comes every hundred years, so in three hundred years, it would have eaten three times? But if it comes every hundred years, then in three hundred years, it would have eaten three times? But the problem says \"over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people.\" So maybe the monster comes once every hundred years, so in three hundred years, it would have come three times. So three ships. So same as before. So the total number of people is 847, which is the sum of the three ships. So same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the ships are built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. So the first ship is some number, the second is twice as much, the third is twice as much as the second, so four times as much as the first. Wait, but if the first ship is x, then the second is 2x, the third is 4x. So total is x + 2x + 4x = 7x. So same as before. So 7x = 847. So x = 121. Therefore, the answer is 121.\n\nBut let me check if the problem says \"ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship.\" So the first ship is the one in the first hundred years, then the next ship is the one in the next hundred years, which is twice as many as the first ship. Then the third ship is twice as many as the second ship, so 4x. So yes, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the first ship is in the first hundred years, then the second ship is in the next hundred years, which is twice as many as the first ship, and the third ship is in the next hundred years, which is twice as many as the second ship. So same as before.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 121. So the first ship had 121 people. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{121}.\n\nWait, but let me check if 7 times 121 is indeed 847. 7 times 120 is 840, plus 7 is 847. Yes, that's correct. So 7x = 847, x = 121. So that's correct.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe the problem is that the monster comes every hundred years, so in the first hundred years, it eats one ship, then in the next hundred years, another ship, and then in the next hundred years, another ship. So three ships. Each subsequent ship has twice as many people as the previous one. So first ship: x, second: 2x, third: 4x. Total: 7x = 847. So x = 121. Therefore, the answer is 121. So I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the ships are built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. So the first ship is in the first hundred years, then the second ship is in the next hundred years, which is twice as many as the first ship. Then the third ship is in the next hundred years, which is twice as many as the second ship. So same as before. So yes, 7x = 847. So 121. So I think that's the answer.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way. Suppose that the first ship is x, the second is 2x, the third is 4x. So total is 7x. But maybe the problem is that the monster comes every hundred years, so in the first hundred years, it eats one ship, then in the next hundred years, another ship, and then in the next hundred years, another ship. So three ships. So total people is 847. So 7x = 847. So x = 121. So answer is 121. So I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the monster comes every hundred years, so in three hundred years, it would have eaten three ships, but maybe the first ship is in the first hundred years, the second in the next hundred, and the third in the next hundred. So three ships. So same as before. So yes, 7x = 847. So x = 121. Therefore, the answer is 121.\n\nI think that's solid. So I think the answer is 121.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{121}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine how many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years, given that:\n\n- The monster comes every 100 years.\n- Over 300 years, it has eaten a total of 847 people.\n- Each new ship has **twice as many people as the last ship**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Determine the number of ships\n\nSince the monster comes every 100 years", "final_answer": "121", "num_tokens": 2048, "num_reasoning_steps": 25, "activations_path": "results_thinking/embeddings/q_0010_17b_activations.npz"}

He has been saving up his money each month for the past three months. He gets a $5 allowance a month. He also mows lawns and shovels driveways. He charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel. After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change. If he mows 4 lawns, how many driveways did he shovel?", "gold_answer": "5", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how many driveways Tobias shoveled. So, the problem says he's buying shoes that cost $95, and after buying them, he has $15 left. He's saving money by getting $5 a month allowance, mowing lawns for $15 each, and shoveling driveways for $7 each. He mowed 4 lawns. We need to find out how many driveways he shoveled.\n\nFirst, let me list out all the information given:\n\n- Cost of shoes: $95\n- After buying shoes, he has $15 left. So, total money he had before buying shoes is $95 + $15 = $110.\n- Monthly allowance: $5 per month. He has been saving for 3 months. So, allowance saved: 3 * $5 = $15.\n- Mowing lawns: $15 per lawn. He mowed 4 lawns, so that's 4 * $15 = $60.\n- Shoveling driveways: $7 per driveway. Let's call the number of driveways he shoveled 'x'. So, the money from shoveling is 7x.\n\nSo, total money he has is the sum of his allowance, mowing lawns, and shoveling driveways. That should equal $110.\n\nSo, equation: Allowance + Mowing lawns + Shoveling driveways = Total money.\n\nSo, 15 (allowance) + 60 (mowing) + 7x (shoveling) = 110.\n\nLet me check that again. Wait, is the allowance saved over 3 months? Yes, he gets $5 each month, so 3 months is $15. Then he mows 4 lawns at $15 each, which is $60. Then he shovels driveways at $7 each. So total money is 15 + 60 + 7x. And that equals $110. So, 15 + 60 is 75, so 75 + 7x = 110. Then 7x = 110 - 75 = 35. So x = 35 / 7 = 5. So, 5 driveways.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nTotal money he has is $110. He has $15 from allowance, $60 from mowing lawns, and 7x from driveways. So 15 + 60 is 75. 75 + 7x = 110. Subtract 75 from both sides: 7x = 35. Divide by 7: x = 5. So, 5 driveways. That seems right.\n\nBut let me think again. Is there any chance that the $15 in change is after buying the shoes? So, total money he had before buying shoes is $95 + $15 = $110. So yes, that's correct. So, the total money he earned from his allowance, mowing lawns, and shoveling driveways is $110. So, 15 + 60 + 7x = 110. So, 75 + 7x = 110. 7x = 35. x = 5. So, 5 driveways. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe considering the total money he earned. Let's see:\n\nTotal money earned: allowance + mowing + shoveling = 3*5 + 4*15 + 7x = 15 + 60 + 7x = 75 + 7x. Which is equal to total money he had, which is 95 + 15 = 110. So, 75 + 7x = 110. So, same equation. So, 7x = 35. x = 5. So, same answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5 driveways. So, he shoveled 5 driveways.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of driveways Tobias shoveled is \\boxed{5}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many driveways Tobias shoveled, we start by analyzing the total amount of money he has saved and how it was earned.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Total Money Available\n\nTobias buys shoes that cost $95 and has $15 in change after the purchase.

How many trees does Randy have in all on his farm?", "gold_answer": "85", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Randy has 60 mango trees. The problem says he also has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees. So I need to figure out how many coconut trees he has and then add them to the 60 mango trees to get the total number of trees.\n\nFirst, let me parse the sentence: \"5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees.\" Hmm. So, the coconut trees are \"half as many as mango trees\" minus 5. Let me write that down.\n\nLet me define the number of mango trees as M. The problem says M is 60. So M = 60.\n\nNow, the number of coconut trees, let's call it C. The problem says C is 5 less than half as many as mango trees. So, half as many as mango trees would be (M)/2. Then subtract 5. So, C = (M/2) - 5.\n\nPlugging in M = 60, that would be C = (60/2) - 5. Let me calculate that. 60 divided by 2 is 30. Then subtract 5, so 30 - 5 = 25. So, Randy has 25 coconut trees.\n\nThen, the total number of trees is mango trees plus coconut trees. So total T = M + C = 60 + 25 = 85.\n\nWait, let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The problem says \"5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees.\" Wait, is that \"half as many coconut trees as mango trees\" minus 5? Or is it \"5 less than half as many as mango trees\" for coconut trees?\n\nWait, the wording is: \"He also has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees.\" So, the structure is: 5 less than [half as many coconut trees as mango trees]. Wait, but coconut trees are the subject here. So maybe it's \"5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees.\" So, the \"half as many coconut trees as mango trees\" would be half of the number of coconut trees? Wait, that seems confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I need to parse it again. Let me try to rephrase the sentence. \"He also has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees.\" So, the phrase \"half as many coconut trees as mango trees\" would be half of the number of mango trees. Then, 5 less than that. So, coconut trees = (half of mango trees) - 5. Which is what I did before. So, half of mango trees is 30, minus 5 is 25. So, 25 coconut trees. Then total trees 60 + 25 = 85.\n\nBut let me check if the wording is different. Sometimes, the phrasing can be tricky. For example, \"5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees\" could be interpreted as \"half as many coconut trees as mango trees\" is 5 less than something? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIf the sentence is \"He has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees,\" then the \"half as many coconut trees as mango trees\" is the quantity, and then 5 less than that. So, if I let C be the number of coconut trees, then:\n\nC = (half as many coconut trees as mango trees) - 5\n\nBut that would be:\n\nC = (M / 2) - 5\n\nWhich is what I did. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the sentence was \"5 less than half as many mango trees as coconut trees,\" that would be different, but that's not the case here.\n\nSo, I think my initial calculation is correct. 60 mango trees, 25 coconut trees, total 85.\n\nBut let me check once more. Let's suppose that the number of coconut trees is 5 less than half the number of mango trees. So, half the number of mango trees is 30, minus 5 is 25. So, 25 coconut trees. Then total trees 60 + 25 = 85. Yes.\n\nAlternatively, if someone misreads it as \"5 less than half as many as coconut trees as mango trees,\" which would be different. But that would be a different interpretation. But the original sentence is \"5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees.\" So, the \"half as many coconut trees as mango trees\" is the quantity, and then 5 less than that. So, coconut trees = (half of mango trees) - 5. So, 30 - 5 = 25. So, 25 coconut trees. So total trees 85.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 85. So, the total number of trees Randy has on his farm is 85.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe total number of trees Randy has on his farm is \\boxed{85}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the total number of trees Randy has on his farm, we need to break the problem into two parts: the number of mango trees and the number of coconut trees.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Number of Mango Trees\n\nThe problem states that Randy has **60 mango trees**.

Jasper is buying some ingredients for his dinner party, and I need to figure out how much he spends in total. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says he buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10. So, the cheddar cheese is $10 for 2 pounds. Then there's a pound of cream cheese that costs half the price of the cheddar cheese. And a pack of cold cuts that costs twice the price of the cheddar cheese. \n\nLet me note down each item and their prices.\n\nStarting with the cheddar cheese: 2 pounds for $10. So, the price per pound would be $10 divided by 2 pounds, which is $5 per pound. But maybe I don't need the per pound price, since the problem mentions the cream cheese and cold cuts in relation to the cheddar cheese's price.\n\nThe cream cheese is a pound and it costs half the price of the cheddar cheese. The cheddar cheese is $10 for 2 pounds, so the price per pound is $5. Therefore, half the price of the cheddar cheese would be $5 divided by 2, which is $2.50 per pound for the cream cheese? Wait, hold on. Wait, the problem says \"a pound of cream cheese that cost half the price of the cheddar cheese.\" So, the price of the cream cheese is half the price of the cheddar cheese. \n\nBut the cheddar cheese is $10 for 2 pounds.

How many hours will it take her to read 120 pages?", "gold_answer": "5", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Joy can read 8 pages in 20 minutes. The question is asking how many hours it will take her to read 120 pages. Hmm, so I need to find the time it takes for 120 pages, given her rate of reading.\n\nFirst, maybe I should figure out how long it takes her to read one page. If she reads 8 pages in 20 minutes, then each page would take 20 minutes divided by 8 pages. Let me calculate that. 20 divided by 8 is 2.5 minutes per page. So, each page takes 2.5 minutes. Then, to read 120 pages, I would multiply the number of pages by the time per page. That would be 120 pages times 2.5 minutes per page. Let me do that math. 120 times 2.5... Well, 100 times 2.5 is 250, and 20 times 2.5 is 50, so 250 + 50 is 300. So, 300 minutes. But the question asks for hours, not minutes. So I need to convert 300 minutes into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so divide 300 by 60. Let me do that division. 300 divided by 60 is 5. So, 5 hours. Wait, is that right?\n\nLet me check my steps again. First, rate is 8 pages in 20 minutes. So, pages per minute is 8/20, which is 0.4 pages per minute. Then, to find time for 120 pages, time equals total pages divided by pages per minute. So, 120 divided by 0.4. Let me compute that. 120 divided by 0.4. Dividing by 0.4 is the same as multiplying by 2.5, right? Because 1/0.4 is 2.5. So 120 times 2.5 is 300 minutes. Then 300 divided by 60 is 5 hours. Yep, same answer. So that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use proportions. If 8 pages take 20 minutes, then 120 pages take how many minutes? Set up a proportion: 8 pages / 20 minutes = 120 pages / x minutes. Cross-multiplying, 8x = 20*120. So 8x = 2400. Then x = 2400 / 8 = 300 minutes. Again, 300 minutes is 5 hours. So that's the same answer. So all methods lead to 5 hours. Therefore, the answer should be 5 hours.\n\nBut let me think again if there's another way someone might approach this and maybe make a mistake. For example, maybe someone might think that 120 pages is 120/8 = 15 times the number of pages she reads in 20 minutes. So 15 times 20 minutes is 300 minutes, which is 5 hours. That's another way to see it. So that's also 5 hours. So yeah, all methods confirm that.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 5 hours. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. The key was to find the rate first, then apply it to the total number of pages, and then convert minutes to hours. All steps check out.\n\n**Final Answer**\nIt will take Joy \\boxed{5} hours to read 120 pages.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how long it will take Joy to read 120 pages, we start by analyzing her reading rate.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Reading Rate\n\nJoy reads **8 pages in 20 minutes**.  \nThis means her reading rate is:\n\n$$\n\\text{Rate} = \\frac{8 \\text{ pages}}{20 \\text{ minutes}} = 0.4 \\text{ pages per minute}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Time to Read 120 Pages\n\nWe now use the rate to find the time required to read 120 pages:\n\n$$\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{120 \\text{ pages}}{0.4 \\text{ pages per minute}} = 300 \\text{ minutes}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Convert Minutes to Hours\n\nSince the question asks for the answer in hours, we convert 300 minutes to hours:\n\n$$\n\\text{Time in hours} = \\frac{300 \\text{ minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes per hour}} = 5 \\text{ hours}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{5}\n$$", "final_answer": "5", "num_tokens": 1064, "num_reasoning_steps": 20, "activations_path": "results_thinking/embeddings/q_0014_17b_activations.npz"}

So, 2.5 times $6 is... let me calculate that. 2.5 multiplied by 6. Well, 2 times 6 is 12, and 0.5 times 6 is 3, so total is 15. So each DVD is sold for $15?\n\nWait, let me check that again. If the cost is $6, and he sells it for 2.5 times that, then yes, 2.5 * 6 = 15. So selling price is $15 per DVD.\n\nNow, the cost to make each DVD is $6. So, the profit per DVD would be selling price minus cost. That would be $15 - $6 = $9 per DVD. Is that right? Yeah, because he's selling it for 15 and it cost him 6, so he makes 9 profit per DVD.\n\nNow, he sells 500 movies a day for 5 days a week. Let me calculate how many movies he sells in a week. 500 per day times 5 days is 500 * 5 = 2500 movies per week. Then, over 20 weeks, that would be 2500 * 20. Let me compute that. 2500 * 20 is 50,000 movies. So total number of DVDs sold in 20 weeks is 50,000.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Is there any other cost involved? The problem says he creates a movie for $2000. Hmm, does that mean that the $2000 is the cost of making the movie, or is that the cost per movie? Wait, the problem says \"He creates a movie for $2000. Each DVD cost $6 to make.\" So, the $2000 is probably the cost of making the movie, but then each DVD is made for $6. So, maybe the $2000 is a one-time cost for the movie, and then each DVD has a cost of $6?\n\nWait, but when he sells the DVDs, he's selling each DVD. So, the initial cost of making the movie is $2000. But does that affect the profit per DVD? Or is that a one-time cost?\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think. If he creates a movie for $2000, does that mean that he has to spend $2000 to make the movie, and then each DVD is made for $6? So, the $2000 is a one-time cost, and then each DVD has a cost of $6. So, when calculating profit, we need to consider both the initial cost of the movie and the cost per DVD.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"He creates a movie for $2000. Each DVD cost $6 to make.\" So, maybe the $2000 is the cost of making the movie, and then each DVD is made for $6. So, when he sells the DVDs, he has to account for the cost of making each DVD. But does the $2000 relate to the number of DVDs? Or is it a one-time cost?\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the problem again.\n\n\"James creates a media empire. He creates a movie for $2000. Each DVD cost $6 to make. He sells it for 2.5 times that much. He sells 500 movies a day for 5 days a week. How much profit does he make in 20 weeks?\"\n\nSo, the $2000 is the cost of creating the movie. Then, each DVD costs $6 to make. So, the $2000 is probably a one-time cost, and then each DVD has a cost of $6. So, when calculating profit, we need to consider the initial cost of the movie and the cost per DVD.\n\nBut wait, when he sells the DVDs, he's selling each DVD. So, the profit per DVD is selling price minus cost per DVD. But the initial cost of the movie is $2000. Is that a one-time cost? So, if he makes one movie, which is then used to make DVDs? Or is the $2000 the cost of making the movie, and then each DVD is made for $6?\n\nThis is a bit unclear. Let me think. If he creates a movie for $2000, that might be the cost of producing the movie, which is a one-time cost. Then, each DVD is made for $6. So, if he sells 500 DVDs a day, then each DVD has a cost of $6. So, the total cost per DVD is $6, and the selling price is $15. So, profit per DVD is $9.\n\nBut then, the initial cost of the movie is $2000. Is that a one-time cost? So, if he makes 50,000 DVDs over 20 weeks, then the total cost would be the initial $2000 plus 50,000 * $6. But then, profit would be total revenue minus total cost.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"He creates a movie for $2000. Each DVD cost $6 to make.\" So, maybe the $2000 is the cost of making the movie, and each DVD is made for $6. So, if he makes 50,000 DVDs, then the total cost is $2000 + (50,000 * $6). But then, the revenue is 50,000 * $15. So, profit would be revenue minus total cost.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $2000 is the cost of making the movie, and each DVD is made for $6. So, if he makes the movie, then he can make DVDs from it? But that seems odd. Maybe the $2000 is the cost of the movie, and each DVD is made for $6. So, the total cost is $2000 plus the cost of the DVDs. But then, the profit would be revenue from DVDs minus the total cost of the movie and the DVDs.\n\nBut the problem says \"He creates a movie for $2000. Each DVD cost $6 to make.\" So, maybe the $2000 is the cost of the movie, and each DVD is made for $6. So, if he sells 50,000 DVDs, then the total cost is $2000 + (50,000 * $6). The revenue is 50,000 * $15. Then, profit is revenue minus total cost.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $2000 is the cost of the movie, and each DVD is made for $6, so the total cost is $2000 plus the cost of the DVDs. So, that would be the total cost. Then, profit is revenue minus total cost.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way. Maybe the $2000 is the cost of the movie, and each DVD is made for $6. So, if he makes the movie, then he can make DVDs from it? But that would be a different scenario. But the problem says \"He creates a movie for $2000. Each DVD cost $6 to make.\" So, maybe the $2000 is the cost of the movie, and each DVD is made for $6. So, the total cost is $2000 plus the cost of the DVDs. So, the profit would be (number of DVDs sold * selling price) - (initial cost + number of DVDs * cost per DVD).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $2000 is the cost of the movie, and each DVD is made for $6, so the total cost is $2000 + (number of DVDs * $6). So, profit is (number of DVDs * $15) - (2000 + number of DVDs * $6).\n\nBut then, the problem says \"He creates a movie for $2000. Each DVD cost $6 to make.\" So, maybe the $2000 is the cost of the movie, and each DVD is made for $6. So, if he sells 50,000 DVDs, then the total cost is $2000 + 50,000 * $6. The revenue is 50,000 * $15. So, profit is 50,000 * 15 - 2000 - 50,000 * 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $2000 is the cost of the movie, and each DVD is made for $6, so the", "final_answer": null, "num_tokens": 2048, "num_reasoning_steps": 24, "activations_path": "results_thinking/embeddings/q_0015_17b_activations.npz"}

If Johnson got $2500, how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?", "gold_answer": "800", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. So there's this problem about Mike and Johnson sharing a profit from a business transaction. The ratio of their shares is 2:5, and Johnson got $2500. Then Mike has to spend some of his share on a shirt that costs $200. The question is, how much will Mike have left after that?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total profit and then determine how much each partner got. Since the ratio is 2:5, that means for every 2 parts Mike gets, Johnson gets 5 parts. So the total parts would be 2 + 5 = 7 parts. \n\nJohnson's share is $2500, which corresponds to 5 parts. So each part is worth $2500 divided by 5. Let me calculate that. 2500 divided by 5 is 500. So each part is $500. Therefore, Mike's share would be 2 parts, which is 2 times 500, so $1000. \n\nWait, so the total profit is 7 parts, which is 7 times 500, so $3500. Let me check that. If Mike has $1000 and Johnson has $2500, that adds up to $3500. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, Mike has to spend some of his share on a shirt that costs $200. The question is, how much will Mike have left after that? The problem says \"spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200.\" But it doesn't specify how much he spent. Wait, maybe I need to figure out how much he spent? Or is there more information?\n\nWait, the problem says \"after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200.\" Hmm. So maybe the shirt costs $200, and he spends that amount from his share. So if his share is $1000, then he spends $200 on the shirt, so he would have $1000 - $200 = $800 left?\n\nBut let me make sure. The problem says \"how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?\" So the shirt costs $200, so he spends $200 from his share. Therefore, his remaining amount is his original share minus $200. \n\nBut wait, is there any other information? The problem says \"the profit from a business transaction is shared among 2 business partners, Mike and Johnson in the ratio 2:5 respectively. If Johnson got $2500, how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?\"\n\nSo, the key points are:\n\n- Profit is shared in ratio 2:5 between Mike and Johnson.\n\n- Johnson got $2500.\n\n- Mike spends some of his share on a shirt costing $200.\n\nWe need to find how much Mike has left after that.\n\nSo, first step: find Mike's share.\n\nSince the ratio is 2:5, and Johnson's share is $2500, which is 5 parts. So each part is 2500 / 5 = 500. Therefore, Mike's share is 2 parts, which is 2 * 500 = 1000. So Mike's share is $1000.\n\nThen, he spends $200 on a shirt. So his remaining amount is 1000 - 200 = 800.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $800.\n\nBut let me check again. Maybe I need to consider if the $200 is part of the profit or something else? Wait, the problem says \"after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200.\" So the shirt is an expense from his share. So yes, he spends $200 from his share, so his remaining amount is his original share minus $200.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick me? Like, maybe the $200 is not from his share? But the problem says \"spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200.\" So it's definitely from his share.\n\nTherefore, Mike's original share is $1000, subtract $200, so $800.\n\nBut let me check once more.\n\nTotal profit is 2:5 ratio. Johnson's share is 5 parts, which is $2500. So each part is 500. Mike's share is 2 parts, $1000. Then, Mike spends $200 on a shirt. So he has $1000 - $200 = $800 left. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in another way? For example, maybe the $200 is not from his share, but the shirt is bought with his share? But the problem says \"spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200.\" So it's from his share.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $800.\n\nBut let me check if there's another interpretation. For example, maybe the $200 is the amount he spent, but the question is asking how much he has after that. So if he had $1000, and he spends $200, he has $800 left. So yes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in another language, and \"spending some of his share\" is a translation issue? But assuming the translation is correct, then the answer is $800.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is that the $200 is part of the profit? But no, the profit is shared between them. The shirt is an expense, so it's from Mike's share. So the answer is $800.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is $800.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{800}\n</think>\n\nTo determine how much Mike will have left after spending some of his share on a shirt, we follow a logical sequence of steps based on the given information:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Profit Sharing Ratio\n\nThe profit is shared between Mike and Johnson in the ratio **2:5**. This means:\n\n- Mike gets 2 parts\n- Johnson gets 5 parts\n\nSo, the total number of parts is:\n\n$$\n2 + 5 = 7 \\text{ parts}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Value of One Part\n\nWe are told that **Johnson received $2500**, and this corresponds to **5 parts** of the total profit.\n\n$$\n\\text{Value of one part} = \\frac{2500}{5} = 500\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Mike's Share\n\nSince Mike gets **2 parts**, his share is:\n\n$$\n2 \\times 500 = 1000\n$$\n\nSo, Mike initially has **$1000**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Subtract the Cost of the Shirt\n\nMike spends **$200** on a shirt.

So, there's a truck with some hard hats, and we need to calculate how many are left after Carl and John take some away. Let me start by listing out the initial numbers.\n\nFirst, the truck has 26 pink hard hats, 15 green, and 24 yellow. So total hard hats initially are 26 + 15 + 24. Let me check that: 26 + 15 is 41, plus 24 is 65. So there are 65 hard hats in total initially.\n\nNow, Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats. So, we need to subtract 4 from the pink count. Let me note that down. So, after Carl takes away, pink becomes 26 - 4 = 22.\n\nThen, John takes away 6 pink hard hats and twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats he removed. Wait, so first, John removes 6 pink. Then, he removes twice as many green as the number of pink he removed. Since he removed 6 pink, then twice that is 12 green. So, John takes away 6 pink and 12 green.\n\nSo, let me check that again. The problem says: \"John takes away 6 pink hard hats and twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats that he removed.\" So, yes, 6 pink and 2*6=12 green. So, John removes 6 pink and 12 green.\n\nSo, we need to subtract those from the respective counts. Let me update the numbers.\n\nFirst, pink: initially 26, Carl took 4, so 22. Then John takes 6 more, so 22 - 6 = 16 pink left.\n\nGreen: initially 15. John takes 12, so 15 - 12 = 3 green left.\n\nYellow: 24 remains, since neither Carl nor John took any yellow. So, yellow is still 24.\n\nSo, total remaining hard hats would be pink (16) + green (3) + yellow (24). Let me add those up: 16 + 3 is 19, plus 24 is 43.\n\nWait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOriginal counts:\n\nPink: 26\n\nGreen: 15\n\nYellow: 24\n\nCarl takes 4 pink: 26 - 4 = 22\n\nJohn takes 6 pink: 22 - 6 = 16\n\nJohn takes 12 green: 15 - 12 = 3\n\nSo, yes, pink is 16, green is 3, yellow is 24. Total is 16 + 3 + 24 = 43.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other step I missed. The problem says \"the total number of hard hats that remained in the truck.\" So, we need to make sure that Carl and John took away only those specified amounts, and that there's no other taking. The problem says Carl takes away 4 pink, and John takes away 6 pink and twice as many green as the number of pink he removed. So, that's all. So, the total remaining is 16 + 3 + 24 = 43.\n\nWait, but let me check the arithmetic again. 16 + 3 is 19, plus 24 is 43. Yes. So, 43?\n\nBut let me check once more. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial counts?\n\nOriginal pink: 26. Carl takes 4, so 22. Then John takes 6, so 22 - 6 = 16. Correct.\n\nOriginal green: 15. John takes 12, so 15 - 12 = 3. Correct.\n\nYellow remains 24. So total is 16 + 3 + 24 = 43. So, 43 hard hats left.\n\nBut wait, let me check if the problem says \"twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats that he removed.\" So, the number of pink he removed is 6, so twice that is 12. So, 12 green. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says \"twice as many green as the number of pink hard hats that he removed.\" So, if he removed 6 pink, then he removes 2*6=12 green. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, yes, the calculation seems right. So, the answer is 43. Therefore, the total number of hard hats that remained is 43.\n\nBut wait, let me check once more. Maybe I misread the problem. Let me read again:\n\n\"In a truck, there are 26 pink hard hats, 15 green hard hats, and 24 yellow hard hats. If Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats, and John takes away 6 pink hard hats and twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats that he removed, then calculate the total number of hard hats that remained in the truck.\"\n\nYes, so Carl takes 4 pink. John takes 6 pink and twice as many green as the number of pink he removed. So, 6 pink and 12 green. So, total taken away is 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 pink and 12 green. Wait, but the pink is 26 - 4 - 6 = 16. Green is 15 - 12 = 3. Yellow is 24. So total is 16 + 3 + 24 = 43. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that when John takes away the green, does he take 12 green, but maybe there's some other consideration? But the problem says \"twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats that he removed.\" So, 6 pink, so 12 green. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 43.

Roque has different modes of transportation for going to work and coming back. The problem says it takes him two hours to walk to work and one hour to ride his bike. He walks to and from work three times a week and rides his bike to and from work twice a week. I need to find the total time he takes for all these trips in a week.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much time he spends walking each trip and then multiply that by the number of times he walks. Similarly, for biking, I need to calculate the time for each trip and multiply by the number of times he bikes. Then add both totals together.\n\nSo, walking to work takes 2 hours, and walking back would also take 2 hours, right? Because it's the same trip each way. So each round trip (to and from) would be 2 + 2 = 4 hours. And he does this three times a week. So for walking, total time would be 4 hours per round trip times 3 trips. Let me calculate that: 4 * 3 = 12 hours.\n\nNow for biking. Riding to work takes 1 hour, and riding back would also take 1 hour. So each round trip is 1 + 1 = 2 hours. He does this twice a week. So total biking time is 2 hours per round trip times 2 trips. That would be 2 * 2 = 4 hours.\n\nThen, adding both totals together: 12 hours (walking) + 4 hours (biking) = 16 hours per week.\n\nWait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me verify each step.\n\nFor walking: 2 hours one way, so round trip is 4 hours. Three times a week: 4 * 3 = 12. That seems right.\n\nFor biking: 1 hour one way, round trip 2 hours. Twice a week: 2 * 2 = 4. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTotal is 12 + 4 = 16. Hmm. That seems straightforward. But let me think if there's any other factor I need to consider.\n\nThe problem says \"to get to and from work a week with walking and biking.\" So, it's all the trips combined. So yes, walking three times and biking twice. So the total time is indeed 12 + 4 = 16 hours.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to check if the round trips are considered as separate trips? Like, each time he walks to work and comes back, that's a round trip. So three round trips walking, and two round trips biking. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone could think that walking to work is one trip and coming back is another, so each round trip is two trips. But the problem says \"to and from work three times a week\" for walking. So each time he walks, he does both directions. So each round trip is considered as one instance. So yes, 3 round trips walking, 2 round trips biking.\n\nTherefore, the total time is 12 + 4 = 16 hours.

Tim bikes to work and back each day for 5 workdays. His work is 20 miles away. Then he also does a weekend bike ride of 200 miles. I need to find out how much time he spends biking in a week. \n\nFirst, I should figure out how much time he spends biking to work and back each day. Since the distance is 20 miles one way, going to work and coming back would be 20 miles each way. So, total distance for one workday is 20 + 20 = 40 miles. \n\nHe does this for 5 workdays. So, for the workdays, the total distance is 40 miles per day times 5 days. Let me calculate that: 40 * 5 = 200 miles. \n\nThen there's the weekend bike ride of 200 miles. So total biking distance in a week is 200 (workdays) + 200 (weekend) = 400 miles. \n\nNow, he bikes at 25 mph. Time is equal to distance divided by speed.

Well, 25 * 8 = 200, so that's 8 hours. \n\nThen the weekend ride is 200 miles / 25 mph. That's also 8 hours. \n\nSo total time is 8 hours + 8 hours = 16 hours. \n\nWait, let me check again. \n\nWorkdays: 5 days * 20 miles each way = 5 * 40 = 200 miles. 200 / 25 = 8 hours. \n\nWeekend: 200 miles / 25 = 8 hours. \n\nTotal time: 8 + 8 = 16 hours. \n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. \n\nIs there any other part? The problem says \"back and forth to work for each of his 5 workdays.\" So yes, each day he goes to work and comes back, so 20 miles each way. \n\nThen the weekend ride is 200 miles. So that's another 200 miles. \n\nTotal distance: 200 + 200 = 400 miles. \n\nAt 25 mph, time is 400 / 25 = 16 hours. \n\nYes, that seems right. \n\nI think that's all. So the answer is 16 hours. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe total time Tim spends biking a week is \\boxed{16} hours.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how much time Tim spends biking in a week, we need to break down his biking activities into their respective distances and then calculate the time for each.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Distance for Workdays\n\n- **One-way distance to work:** 20 miles\n- **Round trip (to and from work):** $20 \\text{ miles} \\times 2 = 40 \\text{ miles}$\n- **Number of workdays:** 5\n- **Total distance for workdays:** $40 \\text{ miles/day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 200 \\text{ miles}$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Weekend Bike Ride\n\n- **Distance of weekend ride:** 200 miles\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Total Distance Biked in a Week\n\n$$\n\\text{Total distance} = 200 \\text{ miles (workdays)} + 200 \\text{ miles (weekend)} = 400 \\text{ miles}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Time Calculation\n\n- **Biking speed:** 25 mph\n- **Time = Distance / Speed**\n\n$$\n\\text{Time for workdays} = \\frac{200 \\text{ miles}}{25 \\text{ mph}} = 8 \\text{ hours}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Time for weekend ride} = \\frac{200 \\text{ miles}}{25 \\text{ mph}} = 8 \\text{ hours}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Total Time Spent Biking\n\n$$\n\\text{Total time} = 8 \\text{ hours (workdays)} + 8 \\text{ hours (weekend)} = \\boxed{16} \\text{ hours}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{16}\n$$", "final_answer": "16", "num_tokens": 1008, "num_reasoning_steps": 39, "activations_path": "results_thinking/embeddings/q_0019_17b_activations.npz"}

Some of the stamps had a snowflake design, some had a truck design, and some had a rose design. Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps. She bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, and 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. How many stamps did Bella buy in all?", "gold_answer": "38", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Bella bought some stamps with different designs: snowflake, truck, and rose. The problem gives me the number of snowflake stamps and then relates the number of truck and rose stamps to that. I need to find the total number of stamps she bought. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps. So that's straightforward. Let me note that down:\n\nSnowflake stamps = 11.\n\nThen, she bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Hmm, so if snowflake is 11, then truck stamps would be snowflake plus 9. Let me write that:\n\nTruck stamps = Snowflake stamps + 9 = 11 + 9. Let me calculate that. 11 + 9 is 20. So truck stamps are 20?\n\nWait, let me check. If she bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake, and snowflake is 11, then yes, truck is 11 + 9 = 20. That seems right.\n\nThen, the next part says she bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So rose stamps are truck stamps minus 13. So if truck is 20, then rose is 20 - 13. Let me compute that. 20 - 13 is 7. So rose stamps are 7?\n\nLet me verify that again. Rose stamps = Truck stamps - 13. Truck stamps are 20, so 20 - 13 = 7. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nNow, to find the total number of stamps Bella bought, I need to add up snowflake, truck, and rose stamps. So:\n\nTotal stamps = Snowflake + Truck + Rose = 11 + 20 + 7.\n\nLet me add those numbers. 11 + 20 is 31, and 31 + 7 is 38. So total stamps are 38?\n\nWait, let me check again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's go through each step once more.\n\nSnowflake: 11. Truck: 11 + 9 = 20. Rose: 20 - 13 = 7. Total: 11 + 20 + 7. 11 + 20 is 31, 31 + 7 is 38. Hmm. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using variables?\n\nLet me assign variables to each type. Let S be snowflake, T be truck, R be rose.\n\nGiven:\n\nS = 11.\n\nT = S + 9.\n\nR = T - 13.\n\nSo total stamps = S + T + R = S + (S + 9) + ( (S + 9) - 13 )\n\nSimplify that:\n\nTotal = S + S + 9 + S + 9 - 13\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3S + (9 + 9 - 13) = 3S + 5.\n\nSo total stamps = 3S + 5.\n\nSince S is 11, plug in:\n\n3*11 + 5 = 33 + 5 = 38.\n\nSame result. So that's consistent. Therefore, the total number of stamps Bella bought is 38.\n\nWait, but let me check if I interpreted the problem correctly. The problem says \"13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps.\" So rose is truck minus 13. So if truck is 20, then rose is 7. That's correct. So 20 - 13 is 7. Yes.\n\nAlternatively, if I thought that \"13 fewer\" meant something else, but no, that's straightforward. If you have X and you have 13 fewer, it's X - 13.\n\nSo all steps check out. Therefore, the answer should be 38.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there's any possible misinterpretation. For example, maybe \"9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps\" is ambiguous? But no, \"more than\" is straightforward. If she bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake, then truck is snowflake + 9. So 11 + 9 = 20. That's correct.\n\nAnother possible mistake: maybe I misread the numbers. Let me check again:\n\nSnowflake: 11.\n\nTruck: 9 more than snowflake. 11 + 9 = 20. Correct.\n\nRose: 13 fewer than truck. So 20 - 13 = 7. Correct.\n\nTotal: 11 + 20 + 7 = 38. Correct.\n\nYes, I think that's solid. So the answer is 38.\n\n**Final Answer**\nBella bought a total of \\boxed{38} stamps.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the total number of stamps Bella bought, we analyze the given information step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Snowflake Stamps\nBella bought **11 snowflake stamps**.\n\n$$\n\\text{Snowflake stamps} = 11\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Truck Stamps\nShe bought **9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps**.\n\n$$\n\\text{Truck stamps} = \\text{Snowflake stamps} + 9 = 11 + 9 = 20\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Rose Stamps\nShe bought **13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps**.\n\n$$\n\\text{Rose stamps} = \\text{Truck stamps} - 13 = 20 - 13 = 7\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Total Stamps\nNow, we add up all the stamps:\n\n$$\n\\text{Total stamps} = \\text{Snowflake stamps} + \\text{Truck stamps} + \\text{Rose stamps} = 11 + 20 + 7 = 38\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{38}\n$$", "final_answer": "38", "num_tokens": 1316, "num_reasoning_steps": 51, "activations_path": "results_thinking/embeddings/q_0020_17b_activations.npz"}

If there are 6 jaguars in a forest, how many beetles are eaten each day?", "gold_answer": "1080", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how many beetles are eaten each day in the forest. So, the problem says that each bird eats 12 beetles per day. Then there's snakes eating birds, and jaguars eating snakes. And we have 6 jaguars. Hmm, I need to find the total number of beetles eaten each day. \n\nFirst, let me break it down step by step. Maybe I should start with the jaguars because they eat snakes, and then the snakes eat birds, which in turn eat beetles. So, the chain is jaguar \u2192 snake \u2192 bird \u2192 beetle. \n\nGiven that there are 6 jaguars. Each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day. So, first, let me calculate how many snakes are eaten by the jaguars. If each jaguar eats 5 snakes, then 6 jaguars would eat 6 times 5 snakes. Let me do that math: 6 * 5 = 30 snakes. So, 30 snakes are eaten by the jaguars each day.\n\nNow, each snake eats 3 birds per day. So, if there are 30 snakes being eaten by jaguars, then the number of birds eaten by snakes would be 30 snakes * 3 birds per snake. Let me calculate that: 30 * 3 = 90 birds. So, 90 birds are eaten by snakes each day.\n\nThen, each bird eats 12 beetles per day. So, if there are 90 birds being eaten by snakes, then the number of beetles eaten by birds would be 90 birds * 12 beetles per bird. Let me do that multiplication: 90 * 12. Hmm, 90*10 is 900, and 90*2 is 180, so total is 900 + 180 = 1080. So, 1080 beetles are eaten by birds each day.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did that correctly. 90 times 12. Let me do it another way. 90*12 is the same as 9*12*10. 9*12 is 108, times 10 is 1080. Yeah, that's right. So, 1080 beetles.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says \"how many beetles are eaten each day?\" So, the chain is jaguar eats snake, snake eats bird, bird eats beetle. So, the total beetles eaten would be the beetles eaten by the birds, which we calculated as 1080. \n\nBut let me check again the steps:\n\n1. Jaguars: 6 jaguars * 5 snakes/jaguar = 30 snakes.\n2. Snakes: 30 snakes * 3 birds/snake = 90 birds.\n3. Birds: 90 birds * 12 beetles/bird = 1080 beetles.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 1080 beetles per day. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any possibility that the beetles are eaten by the birds, and the snakes are eaten by jaguars, but are there any other factors? The problem doesn't mention any other predators or anything else. It just says each bird eats 12 beetles per day, each snake eats 3 birds per day, and each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day. So, the calculation seems straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if the numbers are in the right order. For example, does the snake eat 3 birds per day, so the number of birds eaten by snakes is 3 times the number of snakes. Then the birds eat beetles, so the number of beetles is 12 times the number of birds. So, yes, the steps are correct. \n\nAnother way to think about it: total beetles eaten = beetles eaten by birds. Which is 90 birds * 12 beetles = 1080. So, that's the answer. \n\nI think that's it. So, the answer is 1080 beetles per day. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of beetles eaten each day is \\boxed{1080}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many beetles are eaten each day in the forest, we need to follow the chain of predation:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the number of snakes eaten by jaguars\n\nEach jaguar eats 5 snakes per day, and there are 6 jaguars:\n\n$$\n6 \\text{ jaguars} \\times 5 \\text{ snakes/jaguar} = 30 \\text{ snakes}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the number of birds eaten by snakes\n\nEach snake eats 3 birds per day, and we just found that 30 snakes are eaten by jaguars:\n\n$$\n30 \\text{ snakes} \\times 3 \\text{ birds/snake} = 90 \\text{ birds}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the number of beetles eaten by birds\n\nEach bird eats 12 beetles per day, and we found that 90 birds are eaten by snakes:\n\n$$\n90 \\text{ birds} \\times 12 \\text{ beetles/bird} = 1080 \\text{ beetles}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe total number of beetles eaten each day is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{1080}\n$$", "final_answer": "1080", "num_tokens": 1201, "num_reasoning_steps": 31, "activations_path": "results_thinking/embeddings/q_0021_17b_activations.npz"}

How many letters are in Samantha\u2019s last name?", "gold_answer": "7", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out how many letters are in Samantha\u2019s last name. The problem gives us a few pieces of information, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me note down the given information:\n\n1. Samantha\u2019s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie\u2019s last name. So, if I let the number of letters in Bobbie\u2019s last name be B, then Samantha\u2019s last name is B - 3 letters long.\n\n2. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie\u2019s. Jamie\u2019s full name is Jamie Grey. So, Jamie\u2019s last name is \"Grey,\" which has 4 letters (G, R, E, Y). Therefore, Jamie\u2019s last name is 4 letters long.\n\nSo, if Bobbie took two letters off her last name, her new last name would be B - 2 letters long. According to the problem, this new length is twice the length of Jamie\u2019s last name. Since Jamie\u2019s last name is 4 letters, twice that would be 8 letters. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\nB - 2 = 2 * 4\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nB - 2 = 8\n\nThen, solving for B:\n\nB = 8 + 2\nB = 10\n\nSo, Bobbie\u2019s last name has 10 letters. Therefore, Samantha\u2019s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie\u2019s, which would be 10 - 3 = 7 letters.\n\nWait, let me check if that makes sense. Let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, Jamie's last name is \"Grey,\" which is 4 letters. Then, if Bobbie takes two letters off her last name, her new last name is twice as long as Jamie's. So, 2 * 4 = 8 letters. Therefore, Bobbie's original last name must have been 8 + 2 = 10 letters. Therefore, Samantha's last name is 10 - 3 = 7 letters. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other possible interpretation. The problem says \"Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie\u2019s.\" So, taking two letters off Bobbie's last name would make her last name length equal to twice Jamie's. So, if Jamie's last name is 4 letters, then twice that is 8. Therefore, Bobbie's original last name is 8 + 2 = 10. So, Samantha's last name is 10 - 3 = 7. That seems right.\n\nBut let me think again. Is there a possibility that \"twice the length of Jamie\u2019s\" refers to something else? For example, maybe \"twice as long as Jamie\u2019s last name,\" which would be 8 letters. But the problem says \"twice the length of Jamie\u2019s,\" which is the same as twice as long. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a trick here. Let me check the problem again.\n\n\"Samantha\u2019s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie\u2019s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie\u2019s. Jamie\u2019s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha\u2019s last name?\"\n\nYes, so Jamie's last name is \"Grey,\" which is 4 letters. So, if Bobbie takes two letters off her last name, her new last name is 8 letters. Therefore, Bobbie's original last name is 10 letters. Therefore, Samantha's last name is 10 - 3 = 7 letters.\n\nWait, but let me check if \"twice the length of Jamie\u2019s\" is interpreted as twice the length of Jamie's full name. But Jamie's full name is Jamie Grey, so the full name is Jamie Grey, but the problem says \"Jamie\u2019s last name.\" So, Jamie's last name is \"Grey,\" which is 4 letters. So, the problem says \"if Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie\u2019s.\" So, Jamie\u2019s last name is 4 letters, so twice that is 8. Therefore, Bobbie's original last name is 10 letters. Therefore, Samantha's last name is 7 letters.\n\nHmm. That seems straightforward. But maybe I need to check if there's another way to interpret the problem. For example, maybe \"twice the length of Jamie\u2019s\" refers to the entire name, not just the last name? But the problem says \"Jamie\u2019s last name,\" so I think it's safe to assume that Jamie's last name is 4 letters. So, the problem is straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a trick where \"Jamie\u2019s full name is Jamie Grey\" \u2013 but the question is about Samantha's last name, so maybe the full name is not relevant except for the last name. So, Jamie's last name is Grey, which is 4 letters. So, the rest of the information is about Bobbie and Samantha.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 7 letters in Samantha's last name.\n\nBut let me check once more. Let me write down all the numbers:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet S = Samantha's last name length.\n\nLet B = Bobbie's last name length.\n\nGiven that S = B - 3.\n\nThen, if Bobbie takes two letters off her last name, her new length is B - 2. This is equal to twice the length of Jamie's last name, which is 4. So:\n\nB - 2 = 2 * 4 => B - 2 = 8 => B = 10.\n\nTherefore, S = 10 - 3 = 7.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is 7.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think if there's any other possible interpretation. For example, maybe \"twice the length of Jamie\u2019s\" refers to the entire name, but Jamie's full name is Jamie Grey, which is 7 letters (Jamie + Grey). But the problem says \"Jamie\u2019s last name,\" so it's only the last name, which is Grey. So, 4 letters. Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that \"twice the length of Jamie\u2019s\" refers to the entire name, but the problem says \"Jamie\u2019s last name,\" so I think that's not the case.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of letters in Samantha\u2019s last name is \\boxed{7}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of letters in Samantha\u2019s last name, we start by analyzing the given information step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the relationship between Bobbie\u2019s and Samantha\u2019s last names\n\nWe are told:\n\n> \"Samantha\u2019s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie\u2019s last name.\"\n\nLet the number of letters in Bobbie\u2019s last name be $ B $. Then, the number of letters in Samantha\u2019s last name is:\n\n$$\nS = B - 3\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use the information about Bobbie\u2019s last name after removing two letters\n\nWe are also told:\n\n> \"If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie\u2019s.\"\n\nJamie\u2019s full name is **Jamie Grey**, so Jamie\u2019s last name is **Grey**, which has **4 letters**.\n\nSo, if Bobbie takes two letters off her last name, her new length is:\n\n$$\nB - 2\n$$\n\nAnd this is equal to **twice the length of Jamie\u2019s last name**, which is:\n\n$$\n2 \\times 4 = 8\n$$\n\nSo, we set up the equation:\n\n$$\nB - 2 = 8\n$$\n\nSolving for $ B $:\n\n$$\nB = 8 + 2 = 10\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Find the number of letters in Samantha\u2019s last name\n\nNow that we know Bobbie\u2019s last name has 10 letters, we can find Samantha\u2019s last name:\n\n$$\nS = B - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{7}\n$$", "final_answer": "7", "num_tokens": 1764, "num_reasoning_steps": 53, "activations_path": "results_thinking/embeddings/q_0022_17b_activations.npz"}

She bought some items, and I need to figure out how much each top cost. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says she bought 5 pairs of shorts for $7 each. So, the cost for the shorts would be 5 multiplied by $7. Let me calculate that. 5 times 7 is 35. So, the shorts cost $35 in total.\n\nThen, she bought 2 pairs of shoes for $10 each. So, that's 2 times 10. Let me do that multiplication. 2 times 10 is 20. So, the shoes cost $20.\n\nNow, she also bought 4 tops, all at the same price. Let me call the price of each top \"x\" dollars. So, the total cost for the tops would be 4 times x, which is 4x.\n\nThe total amount she spent was $75. So, the sum of the costs of the shorts, shoes, and tops should equal $75. That means:\n\n35 (shorts) + 20 (shoes) + 4x (tops) = 75.\n\nLet me add the first two amounts together. 35 plus 20 is 55. So, 55 plus 4x equals 75. Therefore, 4x equals 75 minus 55. Let me compute 75 minus 55. That's 20. So, 4x equals 20.\n\nTo find x, I need to divide both sides by 4. So, x equals 20 divided by 4. 20 divided by 4 is 5. Therefore, each top cost $5.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 5 shorts at $7 each: 5*7=35. 2 shoes at $10 each: 2*10=20. 4 tops at x each: 4x. Total is 35+20+4x=75. 35+20 is 55. 55+4x=75. 4x=20. x=5. Yeah, that seems right. So each top is $5. \n\nI think that's all. Let me just make sure there's no trick here. The problem says she bought 4 tops at the same price. So, all the other items are accounted for, and the total is $75. So, yes, 35+20+4x=75. Solving for x gives 5.

She does her shopping only at a specific store where she is allowed a credit of $100, which must be paid in full before her next shopping trip. That week she spent the full credit limit and paid $15 of it on Tuesday and $23 of it on Thursday. How much credit will Mary need to pay before her next shopping trip?", "gold_answer": "62", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Mary goes shopping on Saturday and has a credit limit of $100. She needs to pay the full credit before her next trip. This week, she spent the full $100, and then she paid $15 on Tuesday and $23 on Thursday. The question is asking how much credit she still needs to pay before her next shopping trip.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Mary's credit limit is $100, and she used all of it this week. Then she made two payments: $15 on Tuesday and $23 on Thursday. So, she has already paid some of the credit, and we need to find out how much she still owes.\n\nSo, the total credit she had was $100. She spent all of it, so she had $100 in debt. Then she paid $15 and $23. Let me add those two amounts together. $15 plus $23 is... let's see, 15 + 20 is 35, plus 3 more is 38. So, she paid $38 in total.\n\nTherefore, the remaining amount she needs to pay would be the total credit minus the amount she paid. So, $100 minus $38. Let me calculate that. 100 - 38 is 62. So, she needs to pay $62 before her next shopping trip.\n\nWait, let me check again. The problem says she spent the full credit limit and paid $15 and $23. So, she spent $100, and then paid $15 and $23. So, total paid is $15 + $23 = $38. Therefore, remaining is $100 - $38 = $62. That seems right.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says \"she spent the full credit limit and paid $15 of it on Tuesday and $23 of it on Thursday.\" So, the $15 and $23 are both payments towards the credit limit. So, if she spent the full $100, then she has already paid $15 and $23, so total paid is $38. Therefore, the remaining is $100 - $38 = $62. So, the answer should be $62.\n\nI think that's it. Let me just think if there's any trick here. For example, is there a possibility that the $15 and $23 are payments towards the credit limit, but maybe she had some other charges? But the problem says she spent the full credit limit and paid those amounts. So, I think the calculation is straightforward.\n\nYes, so the answer is $62. Therefore, Mary needs to pay $62 before her next shopping trip.\n\n**Final Answer**\nMary needs to pay \\boxed{62} before her next shopping trip.\n</think>\n\nMary has a credit limit of $100, which she fully utilized during her shopping trip. She then made two payments: $15 on Tuesday and $23 on Thursday. To determine how much credit she still needs to pay before her next shopping trip, we first calculate the total amount she has already paid.\n\n$$\n15 + 23 = 38\n$$\n\nNext, we subtract the total amount paid from the full credit limit:\n\n$$\n100 - 38 = 62\n$$\n\nThus, the amount of credit Mary still needs to pay before her next shopping trip is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{62}\n$$", "final_answer": "62", "num_tokens": 769, "num_reasoning_steps": 15, "activations_path": "results_thinking/embeddings/q_0024_17b_activations.npz"}

He loads up the machine with 175 tennis balls to start with. Out of the first 100 balls, he manages to hit 2/5 of them. Of the next 75 tennis balls, he manages to hit 1/3 of them. Out of all the tennis balls, how many did Ralph not hit?", "gold_answer": "110", "generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Ralph is practicing tennis with this machine, and he has 175 tennis balls to start with. The question is asking how many he didn't hit out of all the balls. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many balls he hit and then subtract that from the total to find the number he didn't hit. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the first part says he hits 2/5 of the first 100 balls. Let me calculate that. If 2/5 of 100 is hit, then 2 divided by 5 is 0.4, right? So 0.4 times 100 is 40. So he hit 40 balls out of the first 100. Therefore, the number of balls he didn't hit in the first 100 is 100 minus 40, which is 60. \n\nThen, the next part says he has 75 tennis balls left, and he hits 1/3 of them. Let me compute that. 1/3 of 75 is... Well, 75 divided by 3 is 25. So he hit 25 balls out of the next 75. Therefore, the number of balls he didn't hit here is 75 minus 25, which is 50. \n\nNow, adding up the balls he didn't hit from both parts: 60 (from the first 100) plus 50 (from the next 75) equals 110. \n\nBut wait, let me check if I did that right. The total number of balls is 175. If he didn't hit 110, then the number he hit would be 175 minus 110, which is 65. Let me verify that. \n\nFirst part: 100 balls, 40 hit, 60 not hit. Second part: 75 balls, 25 hit, 50 not hit. Total not hit: 60 + 50 = 110. Total hit: 40 + 25 = 65. Total balls: 100 + 75 = 175. 175 - 110 = 65. That seems to check out. \n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says he loads up the machine with 175 tennis balls to start with. So all 175 are accounted for. The first 100, then the next 75. So 100 + 75 is 175. So that's correct. \n\nSo the answer should be 110 balls he didn't hit. \n\nWait, but let me check the math again. \n\nFirst 100 balls: 2/5 of 100 is 40. 100 - 40 = 60. Correct. \n\nNext 75 balls: 1/3 of 75 is 25. 75 - 25 = 50. Correct. \n\nTotal not hit: 60 + 50 = 110. \n\nYes, that seems right. So the answer is 110. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe calculate the total number hit and subtract from total. \n\nTotal hit: 40 + 25 = 65. Total not hit: 175 - 65 = 110. Yep, same result. \n\nSo I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes here. So the answer is 110.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of tennis balls Ralph did not hit is \\boxed{110}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many tennis balls Ralph did not hit, we need to analyze the problem in two parts: the first 100 balls and the next 75 balls.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Balls hit in the first 100\n\nRalph hits $ \\frac{2}{5} $ of the first 100 balls.\n\n$$\n\\frac{2}{5} \\times 100 = 40\n$$\n\nSo, he hit 40 balls out of the first 100. Therefore, the number of balls he did **not** hit is:\n\n$$\n100 - 40 = 60\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Balls hit in the next 75\n\nRalph hits $ \\frac{1}{3} $ of the next 75 balls.\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times 75 = 25\n$$\n\nSo, he hit 25 balls out of the next 75.

Jack has 2 liters of seawater in a bucket, and the salt concentration is 20%. He wants to know how much salt he'll get when all the water evaporates. Hmm, so first, I need to figure out how much salt is in the seawater. \n\nAlright, so the total volume is 2 liters. But wait, the problem says it's seawater, which is a bit different from pure water. But maybe for the purpose of this problem, we can assume that the salt is 20% of the total volume. So, if it's 20% salt, then the amount of salt would be 20% of 2 liters. \n\nLet me convert liters to milliliters because the answer needs to be in ml. 1 liter is 1000 ml, so 2 liters is 2000 ml. Then 20% of 2000 ml is... 20% is 0.20, so 0.20 times 2000. Let me calculate that. 0.2 times 2000 is 400. So, 400 ml of salt? \n\nWait, but is that right? Let me check again. If the seawater is 20% salt by volume, then yes, 20% of 2000 ml is 400 ml. But wait, is there any chance that the salt is not 20% by volume? But the problem says the water is 20% salt. So, I think that's correct. \n\nBut let me think again. Sometimes, when people talk about salt concentration, they might mean by mass, but the problem says \"the water is 20% salt,\" so I think it's by volume. Unless specified otherwise, but in most cases, unless stated otherwise, it's probably by volume. \n\nSo, 20% of 2 liters is 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 liters, which is 400 ml. So, the answer should be 400 ml. \n\nBut let me make sure. If the seawater is 20% salt by volume, then yes, 20% of 2000 ml is 400 ml. So, when all the water evaporates, the salt remains, right? So, the amount of salt is 400 ml. \n\nI think that's it. So, the answer is 400 ml. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe amount of salt Jack will get is \\boxed{400} milliliters.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how much salt Jack will get when all the water evaporates, we start by analyzing the given information:\n\n- Jack has **2 liters** of seawater.\n- The seawater is **20% salt by volume**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Convert the volume to milliliters\n\nSince 1 liter = 1000 milliliters, we convert 2 liters to milliliters:\n\n$$\n2 \\text{ liters} = 2000 \\text{ ml}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the volume of salt\n\nThe seawater is 20% salt by volume, so the volume of salt is:\n\n$$\n\\text{Volume of salt} = 20\\% \\times 2000 \\text{ ml} = 0.20 \\times 2000 = 400 \\text{ ml}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Consider the process of evaporation\n\nWhen all the water evaporates, the salt remains in the remaining solution.

Brennan downloaded 800 files first. Then he deleted 70% of them because they weren't helpful. So I need to figure out how many files he deleted in the first round. \n\nAlright, 70% of 800. To calculate that, I can do 800 multiplied by 0.7. Let me do that. 800 times 0.7 is... 560. So he deleted 560 files. Then he had 800 minus 560 left. Let me subtract that. 800 minus 560 is 240. So after the first round, he had 240 valuable files left.\n\nThen he downloaded 400 more files. But again, 3/5 of them were irrelevant. So 3/5 of 400 is the number of irrelevant files. Let me calculate that. 3/5 of 400 is (3*400)/5. 3 times 400 is 1200, divided by 5 is 240. So 240 files were irrelevant. Therefore, the number of valuable files he downloaded in the second round would be 400 minus 240, which is 160. \n\nSo, adding the valuable files from the first round and the second round, he had 240 + 160 = 400 valuable files left. Wait, is that right? Let me check again.\n\nFirst round: 800 files. 70% deleted, so 30% remaining. 30% of 800 is 0.3*800 = 240. That's correct. Then he downloaded 400 more. 3/5 irrelevant, so 2/5 valuable. 2/5 of 400 is (2*400)/5 = 800/5 = 160. So 160 valuable. So total valuable files are 240 + 160 = 400. \n\nBut wait, the question says \"how many valuable files was he left with after deleting the unrelated files he downloaded in the second round?\" So after the second round, he had 240 from the first round, and then 160 from the second round. So total is 240 + 160 = 400. So the answer is 400? \n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says he deleted 70% of the first 800, then downloaded 400 more, and then deleted 3/5 of them. So the 400 new files, 3/5 are irrelevant, so 2/5 are valuable. So 2/5 of 400 is 160. So yes, adding to the 240 from the first round, total is 400. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the total valuable files after both rounds? Yes, because he deleted the first 70%, then downloaded more, and then deleted 3/5 of the second round. So the answer is 400. \n\nBut let me check once more. \n\nFirst round: 800 files. 70% deleted, so 30% kept. 30% of 800 is 240. \n\nSecond round: 400 files. 3/5 are deleted, so 2/5 are kept. 2/5 of 400 is 160. \n\nTotal valuable files: 240 + 160 = 400. \n\nYes, that seems correct.

The first four houses have 3 gnomes each. So, if I calculate the total number of gnomes in the first four houses, that would be 4 houses multiplied by 3 gnomes. Let me do that math: 4 times 3 is 12. So, the first four houses have 12 gnomes together.\n\nNow, the total number of gnomes on the entire street is 20. That means the fifth house must have the remaining gnomes. To find that, I can subtract the number of gnomes in the first four houses from the total. So, 20 minus 12. Let me do that: 20 minus 12 is 8. \n\nWait, is there anything else I need to consider here?

We need to find her previous monthly income.\n\nHmm, let me start by defining some variables. Let me call her previous monthly income \"x\".
