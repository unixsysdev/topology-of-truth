In April, she sold 48 clips to her friends. Then in May, she sold half as many as she did in April. The question is asking how many clips she sold altogether in April and May.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many clips she sold in May. Since she sold half as many in May as she did in April, I should calculate half of 48. Let me do that. Half of 48 is 24. So, in May, she sold 24 clips.\n\nNow, to find the total number of clips sold in both months, I need to add the number from April and May together. That would be 48 (April) plus 24 (May).

He walks to and from work three times a week and rides his bike to and from work twice a week. I need to figure out the total time he spends going to and from work each week.\n\nFirst, let me break it down. For each trip, he walks to work and then walks back. So, each round trip (to and from) would be walking to work and then walking back. Similarly, when he rides his bike, each round trip is biking to work and then biking back. \n\nSo, let me calculate the time for walking a round trip. If walking to work takes 2 hours, then walking back would also take 2 hours, right? Because it's the same distance, so the time should be the same. So, 2 hours going and 2 hours coming back. That makes a total of 2 + 2 = 4 hours per round trip for walking.\n\nThen, he does this three times a week.

Since he goes to work and comes back, that's a round trip. So each day, the distance he bikes is 20 miles going and 20 miles coming back. So total distance per day is 20 + 20 = 40 miles. \n\nBut wait, is that right? Let me check. If the work is 20 miles away, then going to work is 20 miles, and coming back is another 20 miles.
