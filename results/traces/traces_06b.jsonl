Natalia sold clips to 48 friends in April, and then she sold half as many in May. I need to find out how many clips she sold altogether in April and May. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, in April, she sold 48 clips. That's straightforward. Then, in May, she sold half as many as in April. So half of 48. Let me calculate that. Half of 48... Well, 48 divided by 2 is 24.

Wait, the problem says \"twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats that he removed.\" So, if Carl took 6 pink, then John took 6 pink and twice that, which would be 12 green. \n\nSo, John took 6 pink and 12 green.

Also, walking takes two hours each way, and biking takes one hour each way. The question is asking how many hours he takes in total to get to and from work a week with both walking and biking.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. First, I need to calculate the total time he spends walking and the total time he spends biking. Then add those two totals together. \n\nStarting with walking. He walks to and from work three times a week. Each trip takes two hours. So, for walking, it's 3 trips multiplied by 2 hours per trip. Let me calculate that. 3 times 2 is 6 hours. So, walking takes 6 hours total per week.\n\nNow for biking. He bikes to and from work twice a week. Each trip takes one hour. So, two trips times one hour per trip is 2 hours. Therefore, biking takes 2 hours per week.\n\nAdding both times together: 6 hours (walking) plus 2 hours (biking) equals 8 hours. \n\nWait", "final_answer": null, "num_tokens": 256, "num_reasoning_steps": 5, "activations_path": "results/embeddings/q_0018_06b_activations.npz"}

So total distance for the week would be 40 miles per day times 5 days plus 200 miles for the weekend? Let me check that again.\n\nYes, so first, each day he goes to work and back, so 20 miles to work and 20 miles back. So per day, 40 miles. Then he goes on a weekend ride of 200 miles. So total distance for the week would be 40 miles * 5 days + 200 miles. Let me calculate that. 40*5 is 200, plus 200 is 400 miles total. So total distance is 400 miles.

Let me check that. 11 plus 9 is 20. So truck stamps are 20. \n\nNow, she bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So truck stamps are 20, so rose stamps would be 20 minus 13. Let me calculate that. 20 minus 13 is 7. So rose stamps are 7. \n\nNow, to find the total number of stamps, I need to add up all three: snowflake, truck, and rose. So that would be 11 (snowflake) + 20 (truck) + 7 (rose). Let me add those numbers. 11 plus 20 is 31, and then 31 plus 7 is 38.
